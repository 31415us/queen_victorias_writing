She is about Feodore's height, her hair\nvery fair, light blue eyes, of a very gentle, intelligent and kind\nexpression. A Bourbon nose and small mouth. The figure is much like\nFeodore's but rather less stout. She rides very well, which she proved\nto my great alarm the other day, by keeping her seat though a horse of\nmine ran away with her full speed for at least half a mile. What she\ndoes particularly well is dancing. Music unfortunately she is not\nvery fond of, though she plays on the harp; I believe there is some\nidleness in the case. There exists already great confidence and\naffection between us; she is desirous of doing everything that can\ncontribute to my happiness, and I study whatever can make her happy\nand contented.\nYou will see by these descriptions that though my good little wife is\nnot the tallest Queen, she is a very great prize which I highly value\nand cherish....\nNow it is time I should finish my letter.

    "body": "MY DEAREST LOVE,--To make quite sure of my birthday congratulations\nreaching you on that day, I send them by to-day's messenger, and\nconfide them to the care of your illustrious mother.\nMy sincere good wishes for many happy returns of that day which\ngave you, dear little soul, to us, will be accompanied by some few\nreflections, which the serious aspect of our times calls forth.\nMy dearest Love, you are now fourteen years old, a period when\nthe delightful pastimes of childhood must be mixed with thoughts\nappertaining already to a matured part of your life. I know that you\nhave been very studious, but now comes the time when the judgment must\nform itself, when the character requires attention; in short when the\nyoung tree takes the shape which it retains afterwards through life.\nTo attain this object it is indispensable to give some little time _to\nreflection_. The life in a great town is little calculated for such\npurposes; however, with some firmness of purpose it can be done.\n_Self-examination_ is the most important part of the business, and\na very useful mode of proceeding is, for instance, every evening to\nrecapitulate the events of the day, and the motives which made one act\noneself, as well as to try to guess what might have been the motives\nof others. Amiable dispositions like yours will easily perceive\nif your own motives _were good_. Persons in high situations must\nparticularly guard themselves against selfishness and vanity. An\nindividual in a high and important situation will easily see a great\nmany persons eager to please the first, and to flatter and encourage\nthe last. Selfishness, however, makes the individual itself miserable,\nand is the cause of constant disappointment, besides being the surest\nmeans of being disliked by everybody.\nVanity, on the other hand, is generally artfully used by ambitious and\ninterested people to make one a tool for purposes of their own, but\ntoo often in opposition with one's own happiness and destruction of\nit.\nTo learn to know oneself, to judge oneself with truth and\nimpartiality, must be the great objects of one's exertion; they are\nonly attainable by constant and cool self-examination.\nThe position of what is generally called great people has of late\nbecome extremely difficult. They are more attacked and calumniated,\nand judged with less indulgence than private individuals. What they\nhave lost in this way, they have not by any means regained in any\nother. Ever since the revolution of 1790 they are much less secure\nthan they used to be, and the transition from sovereign power to\n_absolute want_ has been as frequent as sudden.\nIt becomes, therefore, necessary that the character should be so\nformed as not to be intoxicated by greatness and success, nor\ncast down by misfortune. To be able to do so, one must be able to\nappreciate things according to their real value, and particularly\navoid giving to trifles an undue importance.\nNothing is so great and clear a proof of unfitness for greater and\nnobler actions, than a mind which is seriously occupied with trifles.\nTrifling matters may be objects of amusement and relaxation to a\nclever person, but only a weak mind and a mean spirit consider trifles\nas important. The good sense must show itself by distinguishing what\nis and what is not important.\nMy sermon is now long enough, my dear child. I strongly recommend it,\nhowever, to your reflection and consideration.\nMy gift consists in a set of views of the former Kingdom of the\nNetherlands, out of which you will be able to discover all those of\nthe present Belgium.\nLet me soon hear from you; and may God bless and preserve you. Ever,\nmy dear Love, your affectionate Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

    "body": "MY DEAREST LOVE,--I am happy to learn that Tunbridge Wells has done\nyou good. Health is the first and most important gift of Providence;\nwithout it we are poor, miserable creatures, though the whole earth\nwere our property; therefore I trust that you will take great care of\nyour own. I feel convinced that air and exercise are most useful for\nyou. In your leisure moments I hope that you study a little; history\nis what I think the most important study for you. It will be difficult\nfor you to learn human-kind's ways and manners otherwise than from\nthat important source of knowledge. Your position will more or less\nrender practical knowledge extremely difficult for you, till you get\nold, and still if you do not prepare yourself for your position, you\nmay become the victim of wicked and designing people, particularly at\na period when party spirit runs so high. Our times resemble most those\nof the Protestant reformation; then people were moved by religious\nopinions, as they now undoubtedly are by political passions.\nUnfortunately history is rarely written by those who really were\nthe chief movers of events, nor free from a party colouring; this\nis particularly the case in the works about English history. In that\nrespect France is much richer, because there we have authenticated\nmemoirs of some of the most important men, and of others who really\nsaw what passed and wrote it down at the time. Political feelings,\nbesides, rarely created _permanent_ parties like those in England,\nwith the exception, perhaps, of the great distinctions of Catholics\nand Protestants. What I most should recommend is the period before the\naccession of Henry IV. of France to the throne, then the events after\nhis death till the end of the minority of Louis XIV.; after that\nperiod, though interesting, matters have a character which is more\npersonal, and therefore less applicable to the present times. Still\neven that period may be studied with some profit to get knowledge of\nmankind. _Intrigues_ and _favouritism_ were the chief features of that\nperiod, and Madame de Maintenon's immense influence was very nearly\nthe cause of the destruction of France. What I very particularly\nrecommend to you is to study in the Memoirs of the great and good\nSully the last years of the reign of Henry IV. of France, and the\nevents which followed his assassination. If you have not got the work,\nI will forward it to you from hence, or give you the edition which I\nmust have at Claremont.\nAs my paper draws to a close, I shall finish also by giving you my\nbest blessings, and remain ever, my dearest Love, your faithfully\nattached Friend and Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

Reading history is one\nof my greatest delights, and perhaps, dear Uncle, you might like to\nknow which books in that line I am now reading. In my lessons with the\nDean of Chester, I am reading Russell's _Modern Europe_, which\nis very interesting, and Clarendon's _History of the Rebellion_. It\nis drily written, but is full of instruction. I like reading different\nauthors, of different opinions, by which means I learn not to lean on\none particular side. Besides my lessons, I read Jones' account\nof the wars in Spain, Portugal and the South of France, from the year\n1808 till 1814. It is well done, I think, and amuses me very much. In\nFrench, I am now in _La Rivalit\u00e9 de la France et de l'Espagne_, par\nGaillard, which is very interesting. I have also begun Rollin.\nI am very fond of making tables of the Kings and Queens, as I go on,\nand I have lately finished one of the English Sovereigns and their\nconsorts, as, of course, the history of my own country is one of\nmy first duties.

I am perhaps rather strangely situated for a\npreaching--somewhat in the style of those old camp preachers who held\nforth to many thousand people on some heath in Scotland. I am also\non an immense heath, surrounded by 16,000 men, mostly young and\ngay, cooking, singing, working, and not very like the stern old\nCovenanters; however, I shall try. First of all, let me congratulate\nyou that it passed happily and well off. Secondly, let me entreat you\nto look with a serious and reflective mind on the day which is past.\nMany are the religions, many the shades of those religions, but it\nmust be confessed the principles of the Christian religion are the\nmost perfect and the most beautiful that can be imagined.... There is\none virtue which is particularly Christian; this is the knowledge of\nour own heart in _real humility_. _Hypocrisy_ is a besetting sin of\nall times, but _particularly of the present_, and many are the wolves\nin sheep's clothes. I am sorry to say, with all my affection for old\nEngland, the very _state of its Society and politics_ renders many in\nthat country _essentially humbugs and deceivers_; the _appearance_ of\nthe thing is generally _more_ considered than the _reality_; provided\nmatters go off well, and opinion may be gained, the _real good is\nmatter of the most perfect indifference_. Defend yourself, my dear\nlove, against this system; let your dear character always be true\nand loyal; this does not _exclude prudence_--worldly concerns are\nnow unfortunately so organised that you _must be cautious_ or you may\ninjure yourself and others--but it does not prevent the being sterling\nand true. Nothing in persons gives greater reliance, greater weight,\nthan when they are known to be _true_. From your earliest childhood\nI was anxious to see in you this important virtue _saved_ and\n_developed_, and Lehzen will still be able to recollect that. If it is\nGod's pleasure that you should once fill the arduous situation to\nwhich you seem destined, you will find the importance of what I now\nsay to you. And when others may tremble to have at last their real\ncharacter found out, and to meet all the contempt which they may\ndeserve, your mind and heart will be still and happy, because it will\nknow that it acts honestly, that truth and goodness are the motives of\nits actions. I press you now against my heart; may God bless you as\nI wish and hope it, and may you always feel some affection for your\nsincerely devoted camp preacher and Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

Oh consistency and political or _other honesty_, where\nmust one look for you!\nI have not the least doubt that the King, in his passion for the\nOranges, will be _excessively rude to your relations_; this, however,\nwill not signify much; they are _your guests_ and not _his_, and will\ntherefore _not_ mind it....",

He was\nblinded by certain absolute ideas, but a good man, and deserving to\nbe loved. History will state that Louis XVIII. was a most liberal\nmonarch, reigning with great mildness and justice to his end, but that\nhis brother, from his despotic and harsh disposition, upset all\nthe other had done, and lost the throne. Louis XVIII. was a clever,\nhard-hearted man, shackled by no principle, very proud and false.\nCharles X. an honest man, a kind friend, an honourable master, sincere\nin his opinions, and inclined to do everything that is right. That\nteaches us what we ought to believe in history as it is compiled\naccording to ostensible events and results known to the generality of\npeople. Memoirs are much more instructive, if written honestly and not\npurposely fabricated, as it happens too often nowadays, particularly\nat Paris.... I shall not fail to read the books you so kindly\nrecommend. I join you a small copy of our very liberal Constitution,\nhitherto conscientiously executed--no easy matter. You may communicate\nit to your Mother; it is the best answer to an infamous Radical or\nTory-Radical paper, the _Constitutional_, which seems determined to\nrun down the Coburg family. I don't understand the meaning of it;\nthe only happiness poor Charlotte knew was during her short wedded\nexistence, and there was but one voice on that subject, that we\noffered a bright prospect to the nation. Since that period I have\n(though been abused, and vilified merely for drawing an income which\nwas the consequence of a Treaty ratified by both Houses of Parliament,\nand that without one dissenting voice, a thing not very likely to\nhappen again) done everything to see England prosperous and powerful.\nI have spared her, in 1831, much trouble and expense, as _without\nmy coming here very serious complications, war and all the expensive\noperations connected with it_, must have taken place. I give the whole\nof my income, without the reservation of a farthing, to the country; I\npreserve unity on the Continent, have frequently prevented mischief at\nParis, and to thank me for all that, I get the most scurrilous abuse,\nin which the good people from _constant practice so much excel_....\nThe conclusion of all this--and that by people whose very existence\nin political life may be but of a few years' standing--is scurrilous\nabuse of the Coburg family. I should like to know what harm the Coburg\nfamily has done to England? But enough of this. Your principle is very\ngood; one must not mind what newspapers say. Their power is a fiction\nof the worst description, and their efforts marked by the worst faith\nand the greatest untruths. If all the Editors of the papers in the\ncountries where the liberty of the press exists were to be assembled,\nwe should have a _crew_ to which you would _not_ confide a dog that\nyou would value, still less your honour and reputation....",

You are aware, I believe, that about a year after\nthe accession of the _present_ King there was a desire to change my\nfavourite and dear name _Victoria_ to that of _Charlotte_, also _most\ndear_, to which the King willingly consented. On its being told me, I\nsaid nothing, though I felt grieved beyond measure at the thought of\nany change. Not long after this, Lord Grey, and also the Archbishop of\nCanterbury, acquainted Mamma that the country, having been accustomed\nto hear me called Victoria, had become used to it, _enfin_, _liked\nit_, and therefore, to my great delight, the idea of a change was\ngiven up.\nI was sure the death of old Charles X. would strike you....\nI thank you much for the _Constitution de la Belgique_. Those attacks\non you are infamous, but must not be minded; they are the language\nof a _few jealous_, _envious_ people. _En revanche_, I enclose a\nparagraph from a speech of O'Connell's I think worth your reading.\nPray, dearest Uncle, say everything most kind to my beloved and\ndearest Aunt, and thank her in my name for her kind letter, which I\nshall answer on Friday. I am happy she and the dear little man are\nwell.\nBelieve me, always, your most devoted and affectionately attached\nNiece,\nVICTORIA.",

Besides, the poor Crown\nis more or less the loser in all this, as it generally ends with the\nabolition of something or other which might have proved useful for the\ncarrying on of Government. A rule which you may thus early impress on\nyour mind is, that people are far from acting generally according to\nthe dictates of their interests, but oftener in consequence of their\npassions, though it may even prove injurious to their interests.\nIf the Tory part of Parliament could have brought themselves to act\nwithout passion, much in the reform of Parliament might have been\nsettled much more in conformity with their best interests. I was\nauthorised, in 1831, to speak in this sense to the Duke of Wellington\nby Lord Grey; the effect would have been highly beneficial to\nboth parties, but passion made it impossible to succeed. This is a\ndangerous part of the business, and we must see during the present\nsession of Parliament if parties are grown wiser.

I have\nfully instructed Stockmar, and I must say he left me in such good\ndisposition that I think he will be able to be of great use to you.\nThe great thing is to act without precipitation and with caution. The\nKing seems better again. I am very curious to know what he proposed;\nyou will have it in your power to modify his proposition, as it is\ndifficult your _approbation_ should be dispensed with; it would be a\ngreat fault in your situation to _submit_ to this.... They seemed to\nthink the King dying, which does not appear to be the case. Be steady,\nmy good child, and _not_ put out by _anything_; as long as I live _you\nwill not want a faithful friend and supporter_....\nHere your somewhat curious little soul has at least the outlines of\nthings....\n_26th._--I received yesterday the whole of the papers concerning the\nKing's propositions. I approve your letter to the King, as it\nis amiable and generous, and this in your position will always tell\nfavourably. I think that if _he_ is well advised he will chiefly\nconsult _your wishes_. This is the footing on which you must place\nmatters. It is not worth while to be told that one is in some sort\nof age when the consequence is that you are not consulted in what\nconcerns you most personally. Avoid in future to say much about\nyour great _youth_ and _inexperience_. Who made the letter? Was it\nyourself, or came it from your Mother?

I am doubtful what to think. We have\nforeseen the case and treated it formerly. The great thing would be to\nmake no change, to keep Ministers and everything as it is, and to gain\ntime; in this way _no one is hurt and no amour-propre bless\u00e9_.\nFor this reason I lean to your keeping, to begin with, Sir Herbert\nTaylor for your _official_ secretary, though I am not quite\n_decided_ on the subject. He knows the manner in which the _daily\nbusiness_ is carried on; this is important. I believe him, and have\nfound him to be an honest man, that would do for State matters; it\nwould not be required that he should be your _confidential_ adviser.\nNow I conclude, and send you this letter through Stockmar.

The effect of all this on the people of this great\ntown has been _very great_, and evidently much ground has been solidly\nregained. The King, getting out of that sort of confinement in which\nit was necessary to keep, has gained much in personal comfort, and\nalso in a political point of view; because to have a King who cannot\nshow himself without being shot at, is a state of society which lowers\nhis authority....\nFor the present the best plan is to continue to act as you have\ndone hitherto; to avoid quarrels, but also to stick _firmly to your\nresolution when once_ taken.

By this system\nyou avoid disappointing those whose hopes may remain unchanged, as\nyour own choices, as it were, are not yet made.

I wish nothing\nbut to see you _happy and prosperous_, and by Sunday I shall probably\nwrite you a long letter, which will enter into details about most\nthings.\nMy object is that you should be no one's _tool_, and though young, and\nnaturally not yet experienced, your good natural sense and the _truth_\nof your character will, with faithful and proper advice, get you very\nwell through the difficulties of your future position, should it be\nthe will of Providence to take the King from this earthly life. Of his\nreal position I am still not quite able to judge, there being so much\ncontradictory in the reports. Be this as it may, the great thing for\nyou is, not to be hurried into important measures, and to _gain time_.\nA new reign is always a time of hope; everybody is disposed to see\nsomething for his own wishes and prospects. The policy of a new\nSovereign must therefore be to act in such a manner as to hurt as\nlittle as possible the _amour-propre_ of people, to let circumstances\nand the force of things bring about the disappointments which no human\npower could prevent coming sooner or later: that they should come as\n_late_ as possible is in your interest. Should anything happen to the\nKing before I can enter more fully into the necessary details, limit\nyourself to _taking kindly_ and in a _friendly_ manner the present\nAdministration into your service. They are _naturally friendly to your\ninterests_, _as you are in fact the only possible Sovereign of the\nwhole family_, with the exception of the Duke of Sussex, they can\n_serve_ with _sincerity_ and _attachment_. This is of great importance\nto you, as it is by no means the same thing to have people who aid and\nassist you with feelings of real attachment, or merely from cold and\ncalculating motives of political expediency and self-interest.\nThis being done, no other step should be taken without consulting\nseriously. The very time which is necessary to attain this end is\nfavourable to you, as it is your greatest interest for the _present\nmoment_ to act most cautiously and to gain as much _time_ as possible.\nIn high positions it is excessively difficult to _retrace_ a false\nmove to get out of a mistake; and there exists very rarely, except in\ntime of war and civil feuds, a necessity for an _immediate_ decision.\nYour part must be, to resume once more what I said before, to\nremain as long as possible _agreeable_ to all parties, and after the\nformation of the Ministry, to be most careful how you take any measure\nof importance....",

    "body": "MY BELOVED CHILD,--... I shall to-day enter on the subject of what is\nto be done when the King ceases to live. The moment you get official\ncommunication of it, you will entrust Lord Melbourne with the office\nof retaining the present Administration as your Ministers. You will do\nthis in that honest and kind way which is quite your own, and say some\nkind things on the subject. The fact is that the present Ministers are\nthose who will serve you personally with the greatest _sincerity_ and,\nI trust, attachment. For them, as well as for the Liberals at large,\nyou are the _only_ Sovereign that offers them _des chances d'existence\net de dur\u00e9e_. With the exception of the Duke of Sussex, there is\nno _one_ in the family that offers them anything like what they can\nreasonably hope from you, and your immediate successor, with the\nmustaches, is enough to frighten them into the most violent\nattachment for you.\n... The irksome position in which you have lived will have the merit\nto have given you the habit of _discretion_ and _prudence_, as in your\nposition you never can have _too much_ of either. Great measures of\nState I hope you will be able to avoid at first. I have already--if\nyou would read it over, and perhaps let Stockmar see it--written to\nyou some months ago on the subject of the necessity of maintaining the\ninfluence of conservative principles, and of protecting the Church.\nYou will do well to keep both objects in view. You will do wisely\nby showing yourself attached to the English Protestant Church as it\nexists in the State; you are particularly where you are, because you\nare a Protestant. I know you are averse to persecution, and you are\nright; miss, however, _no opportunity_ to show your sincere feeling\nfor the existing Church; it is _right_ and _meet_ that you should do\nso. I must repeat that you will do well as long as it will be possible\nto hurt no one's hopes or prospects. That this will not always, or\nvery long, be possible is the consequence of the state of parties;\nstill, one may be frank and honest, and still kind to all. Concerning\nforeign policy I shall write on some future occasion. In the meantime\nI trust you will protect the two Queens in the Peninsula, who are\nmiserably ill off. I am sure, with your good sense you will not find\nit difficult to judge questions yourself. I cannot too much recommend\nthis, as it will then become a habit, and even an amusement to you.\nCultivate always a genuine feeling of right and wrong, and be very\ntrue and honourable in your dealings; this gives great strength. I\nhave taken into consideration the advantage or disadvantage of my\ncoming over to you _immediately_. The result of my _examen_ is that I\nthink it better to visit you later. If, however, you wanted me at any\ntime, I should come in a moment. People might fancy I came to enslave\nyou, while I glory in the contrary; and, thirdly, that they might be\njealous, or _affect_ it at least, of my coming, as if I thought of\nruling the realm for _purposes of my own_....\nI am now at the end, I think, of what I had to say. May Heaven bless\nyou and keep up your spirits. Ever, my beloved child, your faithful\nUncle and Friend,\nLEOPOLD R.\nPardon the hurry in which this letter was written.",

Before I say anything else, let\nme tell you how happy and thankful I am to have Stockmar here; he\nhas _been_, and _is_, of the _greatest_ possible use, and be assured,\ndearest Uncle, that he possesses my _most entire confidence_!\nThe King's state, I may fairly say, is _hopeless_; he may _perhaps_\nlinger a few days, but he cannot recover _ultimately_. Yesterday the\nphysicians declared he could not live till the morning, but to-day he\nis a little better; the great fear is his _excessive_ weakness and\nno _pulse_ at all. Poor old man! I feel sorry for him; he was always\npersonally kind to me, and I should be ungrateful and devoid of\nfeeling if I did not remember this.\nI look forward to the event which it seems is likely to occur soon,\nwith calmness and quietness; I am not alarmed at it, and yet I do\nnot suppose myself quite equal to all; I trust, however, that with\n_good-will_, _honesty_, and _courage_ I shall not, at all events,\n_fail_. Your advice is most excellent, and you may depend upon it I\nshall make use of it, and follow it, as also what Stockmar says. I\n_never showed_ myself, _openly_, to belong to _any party_, and I _do\nnot_ belong to any party. The Administration will undoubtedly be well\nreceived by me, the more so as I have _real_ confidence in them, and\nin particular in Lord Melbourne, who is a straightforward, honest,\nclever and good man.\nI need not add much more, dearest Uncle, but that I trust that the\nall-powerful Being who has so long watched over my destinies will\nguide and support me, in whatever situation and station it may please\nHim to place me!...",

    "body": "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me that the Archbishop of\nCanterbury and Lord Conyngham were here, and wished to see me. I got\nout of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my dressing-gown)\nand _alone_, and saw them. Lord Conyngham (the Lord Chamberlain)\nthen acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had\nexpired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I\nam _Queen_. Lord Conyngham knelt down and kissed my hand, at the same\ntime delivering to me the official announcement of the poor King's\ndemise. The Archbishop then told me that the Queen was desirous that\nhe should come and tell me the details of the last moments of my poor\ngood Uncle; he said that he had directed his mind to religion, and had\ndied in a perfectly happy, quiet state of mind, and was quite prepared\nfor his death. He added that the King's sufferings at the last were\nnot very great but that there was a good deal of uneasiness. Lord\nConyngham, whom I charged to express my feelings of condolence and\nsorrow to the poor Queen, returned directly to Windsor. I then went to\nmy room and dressed.\nSince it has pleased Providence to place me in this station, I shall\ndo my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young\nand perhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am\nsure that very few have more real goodwill and more real desire to do\nwhat is fit and right than I have.\nBreakfasted, during which time good, faithful Stockmar came and talked\nto me. Wrote a letter to dear Uncle Leopold and a few words to dear\ngood Feodore. Received a letter from Lord Melbourne in which he said\nhe would wait upon me at a little before 9. At 9 came Lord Melbourne,\nwhom I saw in my room, and of _course quite alone_, as I shall\n_always_ do all my Ministers. He kissed my hand, and I then acquainted\nhim that it had long been my intention to retain him and the rest of\nthe present Ministry at the head of affairs, and that it could not be\nin better hands than his. He again then kissed my hand. He then read\nto me the Declaration which I was to read to the Council, which he\nwrote himself, and which is a very fine one. I then talked with him\nsome little time longer, after which he left me. He was in full\ndress. I like him very much, and feel confidence in him. He is a very\nstraightforward, honest, clever and good man. I then wrote a letter to\nthe Queen. At about 11 Lord Melbourne came again to me, and spoke to\nme upon various subjects. At about half-past 11 I went downstairs and\nheld a Council in the red saloon.\nI went in of course quite alone and remained seated the whole time.\nMy two Uncles, the Dukes of Cumberland and Sussex, and Lord Melbourne\nconducted me. The Declaration, the various forms, the swearing in of\nthe Privy Councillors, of which there were a great number present,\nand the reception of some of the Lords of the Council, previous to the\nCouncil, in an adjacent room (likewise alone) I subjoin here. I was\n_not_ at all nervous and had the satisfaction of hearing that people\nwere satisfied with what I had done and how I had done it. Received\nafter this, audiences of Lord Melbourne, Lord John Russell, Lord\nAlbemarle (Master of the Horse), and the Archbishop of Canterbury,\nall in my room and alone. Saw Stockmar. Saw Clark, whom I named my\nphysician. Saw Mary. Wrote to Uncle Ernest. Saw Ernest Hohenlohe, who\nbrought me a kind and very feeling letter from the poor Queen. I feel\nvery much for her, and really feel that the poor good King was always\nso kind personally to me, that I should be ungrateful were I not\nto recollect it and feel grieved at his death. The poor Queen is\nwonderfully composed now, I hear.\nWrote my journal. Took my dinner upstairs alone. Went downstairs.\nSaw Stockmar. At about twenty minutes to 9 came Lord Melbourne and\nremained till near 10. I had a very important and a very _comfortable_\nconversation with him. Each time I see him I feel more confidence in\nhim; I find him very kind in his manner too. Saw Stockmar. Went down\nand said good-night to Mamma, etc. My _dear_ Lehzen will _always_\nremain with me as my friend, but will take no situation about me, and\nI think she is right.",

Your\nletter of the 19th, written very shortly before the important event\ntook place, gave me _great satisfaction_; it showed me a temper of\nmind well calculated for the occasion. To see the difficulties of the\ntask without shrinking from them or feeling alarm, and to meet them\nwith courage, is the way to succeed. I have often seen that the\n_confidence_ of success has been the _cause of the success itself_,\nand you will do well to _preserve_ that sentiment.\nI have been most happy to learn that the swearing in of the Council\npassed so well. The Declaration in the newspapers I find simple and\nappropriate. The translation in the papers says, \"_J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9s en\nAngleterre._\" 1. I should advise to say as often as possible that you\nare _born_ in England. George III. _gloried_ in this, and as _none_\nof your cousins are born in England, it is your interest _de faire\nreporter cela fortement_. 2. You never can say too much in praise of\nyour country and its inhabitants. Two nations in Europe are really\nalmost ridiculous in their own exaggerated praises of themselves;\nthese are the English and the French. Your being very national is\nhighly important, and as you happen to be born in England and never to\nhave left it a moment, it would be odd enough if people tried\nto make out the contrary. 3. The Established Church I also recommend\nstrongly; you cannot, without _pledging_ yourself to anything\n_particular_, _say too much on the subject_. 4. Before you decide\non anything important I should be glad if you would consult me; this\nwould also have the advantage of giving you time. In politics most\nmeasures will come in time within a certain number of days; to retrace\nor back out of a measure is on the contrary extremely _difficult_, and\nalmost always _injurious_ to the highest authority.",

There is no branch of information in\nwhich he may not prove useful--\n(1) History, considered in a practical and philosophical way; (2)\nInternational Law and everything connected with it; (3) Political\nEconomy, an important branch nowadays; (4) Classic studies; (5)\n_belles lettres_ in general; (6) Physical Science in all its branches,\netc., etc.--the list would be very long if I were to enumerate it all.\nThe _sooner_ you do this the better; in all countries and at all times\nmen like Stockmar have filled similar situations, even in the most\nbigoted and jealous countries, such as Spain, Austria, etc. You will\nhave him in this case _constantly near you without_ anybody having the\nright of finding fault with it, and to be useful to you he should be\nnear you. Stockmar would have the _immense_ advantage, for so young\na Queen, to be a _living_ dictionary of all matters scientific and\npolitic that happened these thirty years, which to you is of the\ngreatest importance, because you _must study_ the political history of\nat least the last thirty-seven years _more particularly_. I had begun\nsomething of the sort with you, even so far back as George II.; you\nwill do well to go through the reign of George III., and to follow the\nvarious circumstances which brought on finally the present state of\naffairs....\nMy letter grows too long, and you will not have time to read it; I\nwill therefore come to an end, remaining ever, my beloved Victoria,\nyour faithfully attached Uncle and Friend,\nLEOPOLD R.",

Your dear and\nkind letters, full of kind and excellent advice, will always be of the\ngreatest use to me, and will always be my delight. You may depend\nupon it that I shall profit by your advice, as I have already so often\ndone.\nI was sure you would be of my opinion relative to Lord Melbourne.\nIndeed, dearest Uncle, nothing is to be done without a good heart and\nan honest mind; I have, alas! seen so much of bad hearts and dishonest\nand _double_ minds, that I know how to value and appreciate _real\nworth_.\nAll is going on well at present, and the elections promise to be\nfavourable. God grant they may be so! I had a very long and highly\ninteresting conversation with Palmerston on Saturday, about Turkey,\nRussia, etc., etc. I trust something may be done for my sister Queens.\nThey have got a Constitution in Spain at length, and the Cortes have\ndone very well. We hope also to conclude a treaty of commerce with the\nSpaniards shortly, which would be an immense thing.\nIf you could get my kind and dear friend Louis Philippe, whom I do so\nrespect, and for whom I have a great affection, to do something for\npoor Spain, it would be of great use.\nI am quite _penetrated_ by the King's kindness in sending good old\nGeneral Baudrand and the Duc d'Elchingen over to compliment\nme; Baudrand did it very well, and with much good feeling. In\nPortugal, affairs look very black, I grieve to say. They have\nno money, and the _Chartists_ want to bring about another\ncounter-revolution, which would be fatal to the poor Queen's\ninterests, I fear.\nThat you approve my plan about Stockmar I am delighted to hear.\nI hope to go into Buckingham Palace very shortly after the funeral.\nNow, dearest Uncle, I must invite you _en forme_. I should be most\n_delighted_ if you, dearest Aunt Louise, and Leopold (_j'insiste_)\ncould come about the _middle_ or _end_ of _August_. Then I should beg\nyou would stay a little longer than usual, a fortnight at _least_.

I tell you the _trick_, that you should be able\nto guard against it; it is of importance, and I have no doubt will be\nresorted to by various political people.... Ever, my dearest Victoria,\nyour faithfully devoted Uncle and Friend,\nLEOPOLD R.",

    "body": "MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--... There is a great disposition here to be on\nthe best possible terms with England. As it has but too often happened\nthat the diplomatic agents of the two countries have drawn, or been\nbelieved to draw, different ways, I recommended strongly to Count\nMol\u00e9 to give strong and clear instructions to his people,\nparticularly at Madrid, Lisbon, and Athens.... He is going to read\nthem to Lord Granville, and also to communicate as much as possible\nall the despatches of the French diplomats to the English Government.\nThis will be a proof of confidence, and it will besides have the\nadvantage of giving often useful information, enabling thereby the\nEnglish Government to hear two opinions instead of one. It cannot be\ndenied that the idea that the Plenipotentiaries of the two countries\nwere following two different lines of policy has been hurtful to\nthe causes of the two Queens in the Peninsula. To put a stop to this\ndouble action is the only benefit which the Queens will at present\nderive from a better understanding between England and France; but as\nit is, it will be still of some importance to them, and take away from\nthe different political parties the possibility of using the pretended\nmisunderstanding against the Government of the Queens. I trust that\nyou will tell your Ministers to meet this friendly disposition with\nfrankness and kindness. The wish of the King here is, to have matters\nconcerted between the Plenipotentiaries of both countries. In this way\nit would become difficult for the parties in Spain or Portugal to\nsay that the two Plenipotentiaries support different candidates for\nMinisterial power, and the division in the parties connected with the\nQueens might be in this manner _prevented_ or _reconciled_. Many and\nmany are the ill-natured hints thrown out against the King's policy\nhere, and because he is clever, he is suspected of having _ambitious\nschemes without end_; it may not be without some importance to set\nthis, in your mind at least, to rights. Whatever may have been the\nKing's views immediately after the revolution of July I will not\ndecide; perhaps he may a moment have wished to be able to do something\nfor France. Supposing this for the sake of argument to have been so,\ntwo months of his reign were sufficient to show him that the great\nquestion was not to conquer territories or foreign influence, but\nto save Monarchy. He saw clearly that though _he_ might begin a war,\nnecessarily it would soon degenerate into a war of propaganda, and\nthat he and his family would be the first victims of it. His struggle\nhas constantly been to strengthen his Government, to keep together or\ncreate anew the elements indispensable for a Monarchical Government,\nand this struggle is far from being at its end, and most probably\nthe remainder of his life will be devoted to this important task; and\nwhatever may be the more lively disposition of the Duke of Orleans,\ngreat part of his reign if he comes to the throne, and perhaps the\n_whole_ of it, will, _bon gr\u00e9 mal gr\u00e9_, take the same turn. That it\nshould be so _is very natural_, because of _what use_ would be some\n_foreign provinces_ if they would only add to the difficulty of\ngoverning the old? Therefore, knowing as I do all the proceedings\nof the King and his Cabinet, even more fully than I do those of your\nGovernment; seeing constantly in the most unreserved manner the whole\nof the despatches; knowing as the nearest neighbour the system that\nthey constantly followed up towards us, I must say that no one is\nmore against acquiring influence in foreign States, or even getting\nburthened with family aggrandisement in them, than he. He rejected\nmost positively the marriage of Joinville with Donna Maria because he\nwill not have anything to do with Portugal. He rejects a _mille_ times\nthe idea of a future union of the Queen of Spain with Aumale, because\nhe will not have a son where it _is not_ his intention to support him.\nHis fear of being drawn into a real intervention has been the cause\nof his having been so anxious not to have a French Legion in Spain. He\nmay be right or wrong on this subject--I do not decide this, as I was\nof a different opinion last year; but his fear of being drawn too\nfar, like a man whose clothes get caught by a steam-engine, is natural\nenough. His dislike to the ultra-Liberals in the Peninsula is also\nvery natural, because they uphold principles of Government which\nrender Monarchy impossible, and the application of which to France\nwould be the ruin of the King. England, from the peculiarity of\nits position, can do many things which in France would upset\neverything.... I must close my letter, and shall answer yours\nto-morrow. God bless you! Ever, my dearest Victoria, your devoted\nUncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

If one had named a council of wise men to\nfix upon a spot where this might be done with _the least mischief_ to\nthe rest of the world, one should have named the coast of Africa. By\ntheir being there they will render to civilisation a country which for\nabout 800 years has been growing worse and worse, and which was in the\ntimes of the Romans one of the richest provinces.

You know, dear Uncle, that the fleet has orders to protect\nthe King and Queen in case they should be in any personal danger. As\nto Lord Howard, though what you say about him is true enough, it\nwould not do to recall him at present; it would give Bois le Comte\nall the advantage he _wishes_ for, and which would be injurious to our\ninterests and influence.\n(2) With regard to Spain, a very decided mention is made of the\n_Queen_ herself in the speech which is to be delivered by me to-morrow\nin the House of Lords.\nWe have great reason to know that, of late, the Queen has positively\ndeclared her intention to remain at Madrid to the very last.\nVilliers' conduct has been, I fear, much misrepresented, for his\n_own_ opinions are not at all those of the _ultra-Liberal_ kind; and\nhis _only_ aim has been, to be on good terms with the Spanish Ministry\nfor the time being.\n(3) Concerning France, I need not repeat to you, dear Uncle, how\n_very_ anxious we all are to be upon the _best_ and _most friendly_\nterms with her, and to co-operate with her.",

In England the Ministers who are at the head of the several\ndepartments of the State, are liable any day and every day to defend\nthemselves in Parliament; in order to do this, they must be minutely\nacquainted with all the details of the business of their offices, and\nthe only way of being constantly armed with such information is to\nconduct and direct those details themselves.\nOn the Continent, where Ministers of State are not liable so to be\ncalled to account for their conduct, the Ministers are tempted\nto leave the details of their business much more to their\nUnder-Secretaries and to their chief clerks. Thus it happens that\nall the routine of business is generally managed by these subordinate\nagents; and to such an extent is this carried, that Viscount\nPalmerston believes that the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, in France,\nAustria, Prussia, and Russia, seldom take the trouble of writing\ntheir own despatches, except, perhaps, upon some very particular and\nimportant occasion.\nYour Majesty will easily see how greatly such a system must place in\nthe hands of the subordinate members of the public departments the\npower of directing the policy and the measures of the Government;\nbecause the value and tendency, and the consequences of a measure,\nfrequently depend as much upon the manner in which that measure\nis worked out, as upon the intention and spirit with which it was\nplanned.\nAnother circumstance tends also to give great power to these\nsecond-class men, and that is their permanence in office.\nIn England when, in consequence of some great political change, the\nHeads of Departments go out, the greater part of the Under-Secretaries\ngo out also; thus the Under-Secretary (with two or three exceptions)\nhaving come in with his Chief, has probably no more experience than\nhis Chief, and can seldom set up his own knowledge to overrule the\nopinion, or to guide the judgment, of his superior.\nBut on the Continent, changes of Ministers are oftener changes of\nindividual men from personal causes, than changes of parties from\npolitical convulsions; and therefore when the Chief retires, the\nUnder-Secretary remains. There are consequently in all the public\noffices abroad a number of men who have spent the greater part of\ntheir lives in their respective departments, and who by their long\nexperience are full of knowledge of what has been done in former\ntimes, and of the most convenient and easy manner of doing what may be\nrequired in the time present. This affords to the Chiefs an additional\nmotive for leaning upon their subordinates, and gives to those\nsubordinates still more real influence.\nThis class of subordinate men has, from the fact of its being\npossessed of so much power, been invested by the jargon of the day\nwith the title of \"Bureaucratic\"--a name fabricated in imitation of\nthe words \"aristocratic\" and \"democratic,\" each being compounded of\nthe word \"cratic,\" which is a corruption from the Greek word \"kratos,\"\nwhich means power; and the prefix, denoting the particular class of\nsociety whose power is meant to be expressed. Thus \"_aristo_-cratic\"\nis the power of the upper, or, as in Greek it is called, the \"aristos\"\nclass of society; \"_demo_-cratic\" is the power of the people, which in\nGreek is called the \"demos\"; and \"_bureau_-cratic\" is the power of the\npublic offices or \"bureaus,\" for which latter the French name has been\ntaken instead of a Greek word.\nIt appears, then, to be the opinion of Lord William Russell, that this\nsecond class of public men in Prussia are animated by a desire to\nsee the general policy of their country rendered more national and\nindependent than it has hitherto been; that for this purpose they were\ndesirous of urging on the Government to take its stand against foreign\ninfluence upon some point or other, not much caring what that\npoint might be; that they thought it would be difficult to choose a\npolitical question, because on such a question the King of Prussia\nmight be against them, and that consequently they chose a religious\nquestion, on which they knew they should have the King with them;\nand that accordingly they led the Government on to a quarrel with the\nCourt of Rome, and with the Catholic or Austrian party in Germany,\nmore with a view to place Prussia in an independent national position\nthan from any particular importance which they attached to the\nquestion itself upon which the rupture was to be effected.",

I know, however, you have had,\nand still have, _much_ to do. Many thanks, my dear Uncle, for your\nvery kind letter of the 2nd inst....\nIt would indeed, dearest Uncle, be _very wrong_ of you, if you thought\nmy feelings of warm and devoted attachment to you, and of great\naffection for you, could be changed. _Nothing_ can ever change them!\nIndependent of my feelings of affection for you, my beloved Uncle, you\nmust be aware that the ancient and hereditary policy of this country\nwith respect to Belgium must make me most anxious that my Government\nnot _only_ should not be parties to any measure that would be\nprejudicial to Belgium, but that my Ministers should, as far as may\nnot conflict with the interests or engagements of this country, do\n_everything_ in their power to promote the prosperity and welfare of\nyour Kingdom.\nMy Ministers, I can assure you, share all my feelings on this subject,\nand are most anxious to see everything settled in a satisfactory\nmanner between Belgium and Holland.\nWe all feel that we cannot sufficiently or adequately express how much\nBelgium owes to your wise system of government, which has rendered\nthat country so flourishing in every way, and how much all Europe is\nindebted to you for the preservation of general peace; because it is\ncertain that when you ascended the throne of Belgium that country\nwas the one from which the occasion of a general war was much to be\nfeared; whereas now it is become a link to secure the continuance of\npeace; and by the happy circumstances of your double near relationship\nto me and to the King of the French, _Belgium_--which was in former\ntimes the cause of discord between England and France--becomes now a\nmutual tie to keep them together.\nThis, my beloved Uncle, we owe to you, and it must be a source of\npride and gratification to you.\nI perfectly understand and feel that your position with respect to all\nthese affairs is very difficult and trying, and the feelings of your\nsubjects are far from unnatural; yet I sincerely hope that you will\nuse the great influence you possess over the minds of the leading men\nin Belgium, to mitigate discontent and calm irritation, and procure\nacquiescence in whatever arrangements may ultimately be found\ninevitable.\nYou are right in saying that I, though but a child of twelve years old\nwhen you went to Belgium, remember much of what took place, and I have\nsince then had the whole matter fully explained to me. The Treaty of\nNovember 1831 was perhaps not so advantageous to the Belgians as could\nhave been wished, yet it cannot have been thought very advantageous to\nthe Dutch, else they would have most probably urged their Government\nbefore this time to accept it; besides, when these conditions were\nframed, England was only one out of _five_ Powers whose concurrence\nwas required, and consequently they were made under very difficult\ncircumstances. This treaty having been ratified, it is become binding,\nand therefore it is almost impossible to consider it as otherwise,\nand to set aside those parts of it which have been ratified by all the\nparties.\nI feel I must in turn, dearest Uncle, entreat your indulgence for so\nlong a letter, and for such full explanations, but I felt it my duty\nto do so, as you had spoken to me on the subject.\nYou may be assured, my beloved Uncle, that both Lord Melbourne and\nLord Palmerston are most anxious at all times for the prosperity and\nwelfare of Belgium, and are consequently most desirous of seeing this\ndifficult question brought to a conclusion which may be satisfactory\nto you. Allow me once more therefore, dearest Uncle, to beseech you\nto use your powerful influence over your subjects, and to strive to\nmoderate their excited feelings on these matters. Your situation is a\nvery difficult one, and nobody feels more for you than I do.\nI trust, dearest Uncle, that you will, at all times, believe me your\ndevoted and most affectionate Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

    "body": "MY DEAREST AND MOST BELOVED VICTORIA,--You have written me a _very\ndear_ and long letter, which has given me _great pleasure and\nsatisfaction_. I was much moved with the expressions of truly felt\naffection, which it contains, and I shall _never_ again doubt your\naffection for me, but rely on your dear heart and the constancy of\nyour character.\nI will now tell you honestly that I had some misgivings; I did not\nexactly think that you had quite forgotten me, but I thought I had\nbeen put aside as one does with a piece of furniture which is no\nlonger wanted. I did not complain, because I fear if affection is once\non the decline, reproaches only diminish it the faster. I therefore\nsaid nothing, but in a life full of grief and disappointments like\nmine, the loss of your affection would have been one of the most\nsevere. It was in this point of view that the declaration made by\nLord Palmerston at the beginning of May to the Prussian Government\nchagrined me much. It was premature, because the negotiation\nwas not yet renewed. It looked as if the English Government had\nbeen anxious to say to the Northern Powers, who always steadfastly\n_protected_ Holland, \"You imagine, perhaps, that we mean to have\n_\u00e9gards_ for the uncle of the Queen; there you see we shall make even\nshorter work with him now than we did under our late master.\"\nThis impression had been _general_ on the Continent; they considered\nthe declaration to Prussia in this way: \"La Reine et ses Ministres\nsont donc enti\u00e8rement indiff\u00e9rents sur le compte du Roi L.; _cela\nchange enti\u00e8rement_ la position, et nous allons faire mains basses sur\nlui.\" From that moment their language became extremely imperious;\nthey spoke of nothing but acts of coercion, bombardment, etc., etc. I\nfirmly believe, because I have been these many years on terms of great\nand sincere friendship with Palmerston, that he did not himself quite\nforesee the importance which would be attached to his declaration. I\nmust say it hurt me more in my _English_ capacity than in my Belgian,\nas I came to this country _from England_, and was chosen _for that\nvery reason_. Besides, I am happy to say, I was never as yet in the\nposition to ask for any act of kindness from you, so that whatever\nlittle service I may have rendered you, remained on a basis of perfect\ndisinterestedness. That the first diplomatic step in our affairs\nshould seem by your Government to be directed against me, created\ntherefore all over the Continent a considerable sensation. I shall\nnever ask any favours of you, or anything that could in the least be\nconsidered as _incompatible_ with the interests of England; but you\nwill comprehend that there is a great difference in claiming favours\nand in being treated as an enemy....\nI will conclude my overgrown letter with the assurance that you\nnever were in greater favour, and that I love you dearly. Believe me,\ntherefore, ever, my best beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

    "body": "I was awoke at four o'clock by the guns in the Park, and could not get\nmuch sleep afterwards on account of the noise of the people, bands,\netc., etc. Got up at seven, feeling strong and well; the Park\npresented a curious spectacle, crowds of people up to Constitution\nHill, soldiers, bands, etc. I dressed, having taken a little breakfast\nbefore I dressed, and a little after. At half-past 9 I went into the\nnext room, dressed exactly in my House of Lords costume; and met Uncle\nErnest, Charles, and Feodore (who had come a few minutes before\ninto my dressing-room), Lady Lansdowne, Lady Normanby, the Duchess of\nSutherland, and Lady Barham, all in their robes.\nAt 10 I got into the State Coach with the Duchess of Sutherland and\nLord Albemarle and we began our Progress. I subjoin a minute account\nof the whole Procession and of the whole Proceeding,--the route, etc.\nIt was a fine day, and the crowds of people exceeded what I have ever\nseen; many as there were the day I went to the City, it was nothing,\nnothing to the multitudes, the millions of my loyal subjects, who were\nassembled _in every spot_ to witness the Procession. Their good humour\nand excessive loyalty was beyond everything, and I really cannot say\n_how_ proud I feel to be the Queen of _such_ a Nation. I was alarmed\nat times for fear that the people would be crushed and squeezed on\naccount of the tremendous rush and pressure.\nI reached the Abbey amid deafening cheers at a little after half-past\neleven; I first went into a robing-room quite close to the entrance\nwhere I found my eight train-bearers: Lady Caroline Lennox, Lady\nAdelaide Paget, Lady Mary Talbot, Lady Fanny Cowper, Lady Wilhelmina\nStanhope, Lady Anne Fitzwilliam, Lady Mary Grimston, and Lady Louisa\nJenkinson--all dressed alike and beautifully in white satin and silver\ntissue with wreaths of silver corn-ears in front, and a small one of\npink roses round the plait behind, and pink roses in the trimming of\nthe dresses.\nAfter putting on my mantle, and the young ladies having properly\ngot hold of it and Lord Conyngham holding the end of it, I left the\nrobing-room and the Procession began as is described in the annexed\naccount, and all that followed and took place. The sight was splendid;\nthe bank of Peeresses quite beautiful all in their robes, and the\nPeers on the other side. My young train-bearers were always near me,\nand helped me whenever I wanted anything. The Bishop of Durham\nstood on the side near me, but he was, as Lord Melbourne told me,\nremarkably _maladroit_, and never could tell me what was to take\nplace. At the beginning of the Anthem, where I've made a mark, I\nretired to St Edward's Chapel, a dark small place immediately behind\nthe Altar, with my ladies and train-bearers--took off my crimson robe\nand kirtle, and put on the supertunica of cloth of gold, also in the\nshape of a kirtle, which was put over a singular sort of little gown\nof linen trimmed with lace; I also took off my circlet of diamonds and\nthen proceeded bareheaded into the Abbey; I was then seated upon St\nEdward's chair, where the Dalmatic robe was clasped round me by the\nLord Great Chamberlain. Then followed all the various things; and last\n(of those things) the Crown being placed on my head--which was, I must\nown, a most beautiful impressive moment; _all_ the Peers and Peeresses\nput on their coronets at the same instant.\nMy excellent Lord Melbourne, who stood very close to me throughout\nthe whole ceremony, was _completely_ overcome at this moment, and\nvery much affected; he gave me _such_ a kind, and I may say _fatherly_\nlook. The shouts, which were very great, the drums, the trumpets, the\nfiring of the guns, all at the same instant, rendered the spectacle\nmost imposing.\nThe Enthronisation and the Homage of, first, all the Bishops, and then\nmy Uncles, and lastly of all the Peers, in their respective order\nwas very fine. The Duke of Norfolk (holding for me the Sceptre with a\nCross) with Lord Melbourne stood close to me on my right, and the\nDuke of Richmond with the other Sceptre on my left, etc., etc. All my\ntrain-bearers, etc., standing behind the Throne. Poor old Lord Rolle,\nwho is 82, and dreadfully infirm, in attempting to ascend the steps\nfell and rolled quite down, but was not the least hurt; when he\nattempted to re-ascend them I got up and advanced to the end of the\nsteps, in order to prevent another fall. When Lord Melbourne's turn to\ndo Homage came, there was loud cheering; they also cheered Lord Grey\nand the Duke of Wellington; it's a pretty ceremony; they first all\ntouch the Crown, and then kiss my hand. When my good Lord Melbourne\nknelt down and kissed my hand, he pressed my hand and I grasped his\nwith all my heart, at which he looked up with his eyes filled with\ntears and seemed much touched, as he was, I observed, throughout the\nwhole ceremony. After the Homage was concluded I left the Throne, took\noff my Crown and received the Sacrament; I then put on my Crown again,\nand re-ascended the Throne, leaning on Lord Melbourne's arm. At the\ncommencement of the Anthem I descended from the Throne, and went into\nSt Edward's Chapel with my Ladies, Train-bearers, and Lord Willoughby,\nwhere I took off the Dalmatic robe, supertunica, etc., and put on the\nPurple Velvet Kirtle and Mantle, and proceeded again to the Throne,\nwhich I ascended leaning on Lord Melbourne's hand.\nThere was another most dear Being present at this ceremony, in the\nbox immediately above the royal box, and who witnessed all; it was my\ndearly beloved angelic Lehzen, whose eyes I caught when on the Throne,\nand we exchanged smiles. She and Sp\u00e4th, Lady John Russell, and Mr.\nMurray saw me leave the Palace, arrive at the Abbey, leave the Abbey\nand again return to the Palace!!\nI then again descended from the Throne, and repaired with all the\nPeers bearing the Regalia, my Ladies and Train-bearers, to St Edward's\nChapel, as it is called; but which, as Lord Melbourne said, was\nmore _un_like a Chapel than anything he had ever seen; for what was\n_called_ an _Altar_ was covered with sandwiches, bottles of wine,\netc., etc. The Archbishop came in and _ought_ to have delivered\nthe Orb to me, but I had already got it, and he (as usual) was _so_\nconfused and puzzled and knew nothing, and--went away. Here we waited\nsome minutes. Lord Melbourne took a glass of wine, for he seemed\ncompletely tired. The Procession being formed, I replaced my Crown\n(which I had taken off for a few minutes), took the Orb in my left\nhand and the Sceptre in my right, and thus _loaded_, proceeded through\nthe Abbey--which resounded with cheers, to the first robing-room;\nwhere I found the Duchess of Gloucester, Mamma, and the Duchess of\nCambridge with their Ladies. And here we waited for at least an hour,\nwith _all_ my ladies and train-bearers; the Princesses went away about\nhalf an hour before I did. The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put\nthe ring on the wrong finger, and the consequence was that I had the\ngreatest difficulty to take it off again, which I at last did with\ngreat pain. Lady Fanny, Lady Wilhelmina, and Lady Mary Grimston looked\nquite beautiful. At about half-past four I re-entered my carriage,\nthe Crown on my head, and the Sceptre and Orb in my hands, and we\nproceeded the same way as we came--the crowds if possible having\nincreased. The enthusiasm, affection, and loyalty were really\ntouching, and I shall ever remember this day as the _Proudest_ of my\nlife! I came home at a little after six, really _not_ feeling tired.\nAt eight we dined. Besides we thirteen--my Uncles, sister, brother,\nSp\u00e4th, and the Duke's gentlemen--my excellent Lord Melbourne and Lord\nSurrey dined here. Lord Melbourne came up to me and said: \"I must\ncongratulate you on this most brilliant day,\" and that all had gone\noff so well. He said he was not tired, and was in high spirits. I\nsat between Uncle Ernest and Lord Melbourne; and Lord Melbourne\nbetween me and Feodore, whom he had led in. My kind Lord Melbourne was\nmuch affected in speaking of the whole ceremony. He asked kindly if I\nwas tired; said the Sword he carried (the first, the Sword of State)\nwas excessively heavy. I said that the Crown hurt me a good deal. He\nwas so much amused at Uncle Ernest's being astonished at our still\nhaving the Litany. We agreed that the whole thing was a very fine\nsight. He thought the robes, and particularly the Dalmatic, \"looked\nremarkably well.\" \"And you did it all so well--excellent!\" said he,\nwith tears in his eyes. He said he thought I looked rather pale and\n\"moved by all the people\" when I arrived; \"and that's natural;\nand that's better.\" The Archbishop's and Dean's copes, which were\nremarkably handsome, were from James the Second's time; the very same\nthat were worn at his Coronation, Lord Melbourne told me. Spoke of the\nBishop of Durham's awkwardness, Lord Rolle's fall, etc. Of the Duc\nde Nemours being like his father in face; of the young ladies'\n(train-bearers') dresses; which he thought beautiful; and he said\nhe thought the Duchess of Richmond (who had ordered the make of the\ndresses, etc., and had been much condemned by some of the young ladies\nfor it) quite right. She said to him: \"One thing I was determined\nabout; that I would have no discussion with their Mammas about it.\"\nSpoke of Talleyrand and Soult having been very much struck by the\nceremony of the Coronation; of the English being far too generous\n_not_ to be kind to Soult. Lord Melbourne went home the night before,\nand slept very deeply till he was woke at six in the morning. I said I\ndid not sleep well. Spoke of the Illuminations and Uncle Ernest's wish\nto see them.\nAfter dinner, before we sat down, we (that is Charles, Lord Melbourne,\nand I) spoke of the numbers of Peers at the Coronation, which, Lord\nMelbourne said, with the tears in his eyes, was unprecedented. I\nobserved that there were very few Viscounts; he said: \"There are very\nfew Viscounts,\" that they were an odd sort of title and not really\nEnglish; that they came from _Vice-Comit\u00e9s_; that Dukes and Barons\nwere the only _real_ English titles; that Marquises were likewise not\nEnglish; and that they made people Marquises when they did not wish to\nmake them Dukes. Spoke of Lord Audley who came as the First Baron, and\nwho Lord Melbourne said was a very odd young man, but of a very old\nfamily; his ancestor was a Sir Something Audley in the time of the\nBlack Prince, who, with Chandos, gained the Battle of Poictiers.\nI then sat on the sofa for a little while with Lady Barham and then\nwith Charles; Lord Melbourne sitting near me the whole evening. Mamma\nand Feodore remained to see the illuminations and only came in later,\nand Mamma went away before I did. Uncle Ernest drove out to see the\nIlluminations.\nI said to Lord Melbourne when I first sat down that I felt a little\ntired on my feet; \"You must be very tired,\" he said. Spoke of the\nweight of the Robes, etc., etc., the Coronets; and he turned round to\nme with the tears in his eyes, and said _so_ kindly: \"And you did it\nbeautifully--every part of it, with so much taste; it's a thing that\nyou can't give a person advice upon; it must be left to a person.\"\nTo hear this, from this kind impartial friend, gave me great and real\npleasure. Mamma and Feodore came back just after he said this. Spoke\nof the Bishops' Copes, about which he was very funny; of the Pages who\nwere such a nice set of boys, and who were so handy, Lord Melbourne\nsaid, that they kept them the whole time. Little Lord Stafford and\nSlane (Lord Mountcharles) were pages to their fathers and looked\nlovely; Lord Paget (not a fine boy) was Lord Melbourne's page and\nremarkably handy, he said. Spoke again of the young ladies' dresses,\nabout which he was very amusing; he waited for his carriage with Lady\nMary Talbot and Lady Wilhelmina; he thinks Lady Fanny does not make as\nmuch show as other girls, which I would not allow. He set off for the\nAbbey from his house at half-past eight, and was there long before\nanybody else; he only got home at half-past six and had to go round\nby Kensington. He said there was a large breakfast in the Jerusalem\nChamber where they met _before_ all began; he said, laughing, that\nwhenever the Clergy, or a Dean and Chapter, had anything to do with\nanything, there's sure to be plen'y to eat.\nSpoke of my intending to go to bed, etc.; he said, \"You may depend\nupon it, you are more tired than you think you are.\" I said I had\nslept badly the night before; he said that was my mind, that nothing\nkept people more awake than any consciousness of a great event going\nto take place, and being agitated. He was not sure if he was not going\nto the Duke of Wellington's.\nStayed in the dining room till twenty minutes past eleven, but\nremained on Mamma's balcony looking at the fireworks in Green Park,\nwhich were quite beautiful.\nUncle Ernest, Charles, Feodore, and the Ladies and Gentlemen (like\nLehzen, etc.) saw me leave the Palace, arrive at the Abbey, leave the\nAbbey, and return to the Palace. Got a long letter from Aunt Louise.",

It\nwas most kind of you to have written so soon after our departure, and\nsuch an affectionate, good, kind letter. The tears came to my eyes\nas I read it, and I felt quite moved. Short as has been our stay,\nand great, as always, the pain of leaving you, it has been a _great\nhappiness_ for me to see you again, a happiness for which I shall\nalways thank God, you, and your dear Uncle. I need not add how _very\nprecious_ is your affection to me, and how _very grateful_ I am for\nevery new proof of it. You know my feelings on this point, and\nyou know they are better _felt_ than _expressed_. Your calling me\n_Louise_, and in such a kind way, gave me great pleasure. Almost all\nthose dear to me call me so, and I think it looks more affectionate;\nI would fain say now _sister-like_, although I am rather an old sister\nfor you now....\nLeopold is half crazy with the steam-engine, and particularly with\nthe _tools_ which you sent him.

He has found again his kie (key), and he wears it suspended\nto his neck by a blue riband, with the Duchess's little seal. He felt\ndeeply the attention you had to have an _L_ engraved on each tool, and\nafter his letter was closed he charged me to thank you for it, and\nto tell you that it gave him great pleasure. An _iron spade_ was the\ngreatest object of his ambition, and he worked so hard yesterday with\nit, that I feared he would hurt himself with the exertion. He will go\nto-day to the races with us, in the Scotch dress which the Duchess had\nthe kindness to send him. It fits very well, and he is very proud of\nhaving a coat shaped _like that of a man_....",

It\nwould have been better if Lord Normanby had acquainted Lord Melbourne\nquietly of this, and not made it at once public to all the world. It\nis not necessary to do anything at present. If Lord Durham remains,\nwhich Lord Melbourne does not, however, think likely, there will be\nno successor to be appointed, and if he returns, the authority of\nGovernor of Lower Canada will devolve upon Sir John Colborne, in\nwhose hands it may be very safely left for the present.\nIf Ireland should be vacant, there is a strong feeling amongst many\nthat it would be nice to name the Duke of Sussex. It is said that it\nwould be popular in Ireland, that the name of one of the Royal Family\nwould do good there, and that it would afford to O'Connell a pretext\nand opportunity for giving up his new scheme of agitation. It is also\nadded that the Duke would suffer himself to be guided on all essential\nmatters by the advice of his Chief Secretary, and that he would\ncontent himself with discharging the ceremonial duties. Here are the\nreasons for it--your Majesty is so well acquainted with the reasons on\nthe other side, that it is unnecessary for me to detail them.\nI am afraid that times of some trouble are approaching, for which\nyour Majesty must hold yourself prepared; but your Majesty is too well\nacquainted with the nature of human affairs not to be well aware\nthat they cannot very well go on even as quietly as they have gone on\nduring the last sixteen months.",

She was safely confined on the 20th of October\nwith a little girl, who bears my name, and seemed to be going on very\nwell; but on Wednesday she began to sink from weakness, not disease,\nand died at three o'clock on Thursday. It is a dreadful blow to _him_,\nfor he was _so_ attached to her, and I don't believe two people ever\nwere happier together. I send you his pretty letter to me, which I\nthink you may be interested to see; he is _dreadfully_ beat down by\nit, but struggles manfully against his grief, which makes one pity him\nmore. She has left four children by her first husband, _now orphans_,\nthe eldest a sweet girl twelve years old, and two little girls by Lord\nJohn; the eldest of these two is two and a half, and the youngest a\n_fortnight_. I had known her _very_ well and liked her, and I assure\nyou I was dreadfully shocked at it. You may also imagine what a loss\nshe is to poor Miss Lister, who has no mother, and whose only sister\nshe was. I fear, dear Uncle, I have made a sad and melancholy letter\nof this, but I have been so much engrossed by all this misery, and\nknowing you take an interest in poor Lord John, that I let my pen run\non almost involuntarily.\nWe have very good accounts of the Queen-Dowager from Gibraltar.\nPlease return me Lord John's letter when you have done with it.\nLord and Lady Howard have been here, and I urged him to _bear_\nDietz as an inevitable evil, and I think he seems very anxious to do\nwhat is right. I have likewise written to Ferdinand, urging _him_ and\nDietz to be reasonable.\nWill you tell Aunt Louise that she will receive a box containing the\nLimerick lace dress (just like mine), which I lay at her feet.

That advice is, at once\nto send for the Duke of Wellington. Your Majesty appears to Lord\nMelbourne to have no other alternative. The Radicals have neither\nability, honesty, nor numbers. They have no leaders of any character.\nLord Durham was raised, one hardly knows how, into something of a\nfactitious importance by his own extreme opinions, by the panegyrics\nof those who thought he would serve them as an instrument, and by the\nmanagement of the Press, but any little public reputation which he\nmight once have acquired has been entirely dissipated and destroyed by\nthe continued folly of his conduct in his Canadian Government. There\nis no party in the State to which your Majesty can now resort, except\nthat great party which calls itself Conservative, and of that party,\nhis rank, station, reputation, and experience point out the Duke of\nWellington as the person to whom your Majesty should apply.\nLord Melbourne therefore advises that your Majesty should send for the\nDuke of Wellington, and should acquaint him, provided your Majesty so\nfeels, that you were entirely satisfied with your late Government, and\nthat you part from them with reluctance; but that as he and the party\nof which he is the head have been the means of removing them from\noffice, you naturally look to him to advise you as to the means of\nsupplying their places and carrying on the business of the country.\nIf the Duke should be unwilling to form the Government himself, and\nshould desire to devolve the task upon Sir Robert Peel, Lord Melbourne\nwould advise your Majesty to accede to that suggestion; but Lord\nMelbourne would counsel your Majesty to be very unwilling to suffer\nthe Government to be formed by Sir Robert Peel, without the active\nassistance in office of the Duke of Wellington.\nWith respect both to measures and appointments, your Majesty should\nplace the fullest confidence in those to whom you entrust the\nmanagement of affairs, exercising at the same time, and fully\nexpressing, your own judgment upon both.\nYour Majesty will do well to be from the beginning very vigilant that\nall measures and all appointments are stated to your Majesty in the\nfirst instance, and your Majesty's pleasure taken thereon previously\nto any instruments being drawn out for carrying them into effect, and\nsubmitted to your Majesty's signature. It is the more necessary to be\nwatchful and active in this respect, as the extreme confidence which\nyour Majesty has reposed in me may have led to some omission at times\nof these most necessary preliminaries.\nThe patronage of the Lord Chamberlain's Department is of the greatest\nimportance, and may be made to conduce at once to the beneficial\ninfluence of the Crown, and to the elevation and encouragement of the\nprofessions of the Church and of Medicine. This patronage, by being\nleft to the uncontrolled exercise of successive Lord Chamberlains, has\nbeen administered not only wastefully but perniciously. The physicians\nto the late King were many of them men of little eminence; the\nchaplains are still a sorry set. Your Majesty should insist with the\nnew Ministers that this patronage should be disposed of, not by the\nLord Chamberlain, but, as it has hitherto been during your Majesty's\nreign, by your Majesty upon consultation with your Prime Minister.",

    "body": "The Queen told Lord Melbourne she would give him an account of what\npassed, which she is _very_ anxious to do. She saw the Duke for about\ntwenty minutes; the Queen said she supposed he knew why she sent for\nhim, upon which the Duke said, No, he had no idea. The Queen then said\nthat she had had the greatest confidence in her late Ministry, and\nhad parted with them with the greatest reluctance; upon which the Duke\nobserved that he could assure me no one felt more pain in hearing the\nannouncement of their resignation than he did, and that he was deeply\ngrieved at it. The Queen then continued, that as his party had been\ninstrumental in removing them, that she must look to him to form a\nnew Government. The Duke answered that he had no power whatever in\nthe House of Commons, \"that if he was to say black was white, they\nwould say it was not,\" and that he advised me to send for Sir Robert\nPeel, in whom I could place confidence, and who was a gentleman and a\nman of honour and integrity. The Queen then said she hoped he would at\nall events have a place in the new Cabinet. The Duke at first rather\nrefused, and said he was so deaf, and so old and unfit for any\ndiscussion, that if he were to consult his own feelings he would\nrather not do it, and remain quite aloof; but that as he was very\nanxious to do anything that would tend to the Queen's comfort, and\nwould do everything and at all times that could be of use to the\nQueen, and therefore if she and her Prime Minister urged his accepting\noffice, he would. The Queen said she had more confidence in him\nthan in any of the others of his party. The Queen then mentioned the\nsubject of the Household, and of those who were not in Parliament. The\nDuke did not give any decisive answer about it, but advised the Queen\nnot to begin with conditions of this sort, and wait till the matter\nwas proposed. The Queen then said that she felt certain he would\nunderstand the great friendship she had for Lord Melbourne, who had\nbeen to her quite a parent, and the Duke said _no one felt and knew\nthat better than he did, and that no one could still be of greater\nuse to the Queen than Lord Melbourne_. The Duke spoke of his personal\nfriendship for Lord Melbourne, and that he hoped I knew that he had\noften done all he could to help your (Lord Melbourne's) Government.\nThe Queen then mentioned her intention to prove her great _fairness_\nto her new Government in telling them, that they might know there was\nno unfair dealing, that I meant to see you often as a friend, as I\nowed _so_ much to you. The Duke said he quite understood it, and knew\nI would not exercise this to weaken the Government, and that he would\ntake my part about it, and felt for me. He was very kind, and said he\ncalled it \"a misfortune\" that you had all left me.\nThe Queen wrote to Peel, who came after two, embarrassed and put out.\nThe Queen repeated what she had said to the Duke about her former\nGovernment, and asked Sir Robert to form a new Ministry. He does not\nseem sanguine; says entering the Government in a minority is very\ndifficult; he felt unequal to the task, and far from exulting in what\nhad happened, as he knew what pain it must give me; he quite approved\nthat the Duke should take office, and saw the importance of it; meant\nto offer him the post of Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and if he\nrefused, Lord Aberdeen; Lord Lyndhurst, Chancellor; hoped to secure\nStanley and Graham; Goulburn to be the candidate for the Speaker's\nChair; he expects a severe conflict then, and if he should be beat\nmust either resign or dissolve Parliament. Before this the Queen said\nshe was against a dissolution, in which he quite agreed, but of course\nwished no conditions should be made; he felt the task arduous, and\nthat he would require me to demonstrate (_a certain_ degree, if _any_\nI can only feel) confidence in the Government, and that my Household\nwould be one of the marks of that. The Queen mentioned the same thing\nabout her Household, to which he at present would give no answer, and\nsaid nothing should be done without my knowledge or approbation. He\nrepeated his surprise at the course you had all taken in resigning,\nwhich he did not expect. The Queen talked of her great friendship for,\nand gratitude to Lord Melbourne, and repeated what she had said to the\nDuke, in which Peel agreed; but he is such a cold, odd man she can't\nmake out what he means. He said he couldn't expect me to have the\nconfidence in him I had in you (and which he never can have) as he has\nnot deserved it. My impression is, he is not _happy_ and sanguine. He\ncomes to me to-morrow at one to report progress in his formation of\nthe new Government. The Queen don't like his manner after--oh! how\ndifferent, how dreadfully different, to that frank, open, natural and\nmost kind, warm manner of Lord Melbourne. The Duke I like by far\nbetter to Peel. The Queen trusts Lord Melbourne will excuse this long\nletter, but she was so very anxious he should know all. The Queen was\nvery much collected, and betrayed no agitation during these two\ntrying Audiences. But afterwards again _all_ gave way. She feels Lord\nMelbourne will understand it, amongst enemies to those she most relied\non and esteemed, and people who seem to have no heart; but what is\nworst of all is the being deprived of seeing Lord Melbourne as she\nused to do.",

He has read\nwith the greatest attention the very clear and distinct account which\nyour Majesty has written of that which passed at the Audiences which\nyour Majesty has given to the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel.\nNothing could have been more proper and judicious than your Majesty's\nconduct, and they appear to have acted upon their part with propriety\nand sincerity. Lord Melbourne has no doubt that both with respect\nto him (Lord Melbourne) and to themselves and their own feelings and\nposition, they expressed what they really think. The Duke was right in\nsaying that in general, in affairs of this nature, it is best not to\nbegin with conditions; but this matter of the Household is so personal\nto yourself, that it was best to give an intimation of your feelings\nupon it in the first instance. Lord Melbourne has little doubt that if\nthey could have acted from themselves, they would have acceded to your\nMajesty's wish at once; but your Majesty must recollect that they have\nothers to satisfy, and must not attribute entirely to them anything\nthat is harsh and unreasonable. Lord Melbourne advises your Majesty\nto urge this question of the Household strongly as a matter due to\nyourself and your own wishes; but if Sir Robert is unable to concede\nit, it will not do to refuse and to put off the negotiation upon it.\nLord Melbourne would strongly advise your Majesty to do everything to\nfacilitate the formation of the Government. Everything is to be\ndone and to be endured rather than run the risk of getting into the\nsituation in which they are in France, of no party being able to form\na Government and conduct the affairs of the country.\nThe Dissolution of Parliament is a matter of still more importance,\nand if this should be again pressed upon your Majesty, Lord Melbourne\nwould advise your Majesty to reserve your opinion, not to give a\npromise that you will dissolve, nor to say positively that you\nwill not. You may say that you do not think it right to fetter the\nPrerogative of the Crown by previous engagements, that a dissolution\nof Parliament is to be decided according to the circumstances at the\ntime, that you mean to give full confidence to the Government that\nshall be formed, and to do everything in your power to support them,\nand that you will consider whether Parliament shall be dissolved, when\nyou are advised to dissolve it, and have before you the reasons for\nsuch a measure.\nLord Melbourne earnestly entreats your Majesty not to suffer yourself\nto be affected by any faultiness of manner which you may observe.\nDepend upon it, there is no personal hostility to Lord Melbourne nor\nany bitter feelings against him. Sir Robert is the most cautious and\nreserved of mankind. Nobody seems to Lord Melbourne to know him, but\nhe is not therefore deceitful or dishonest. Many a very false man has\na very open sincere manner, and _vice vers\u00e2_....\nLord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty is better this\nmorning.",

    "body": "At half-past six came Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till ten\nminutes past seven.\nI then began by giving him a detailed account of the whole proceeding,\nwhich I shall state here as briefly as possible. I first again related\nwhat took place in the two first interviews, and when I said that\nthe Duke said he had assisted my Government often very much, Lord\nMelbourne said: \"Well, that is true enough, but the Duke did all he\ncould about this vote.\" \"Well, then,\" I said, \"when Sir Robert Peel\ncame this morning, he began first about the Ministry. I consented,\nthough I said I might have my personal feelings about Lord Lyndhurst\nand Lord Aberdeen, but that I would suppress every personal feeling\nand be quite fair. I then repeated that I wished to retain about me\nthose who were not in Parliament, and Sir Robert _pretended_ that\nI had the preceding day expressed a wish to keep about me those who\n_were_ in Parliament. I mentioned my wish to have Lord Liverpool, to\nwhich Sir Robert readily acceded, saying he would offer him the place\nof Lord Steward, or of Lord in Waiting. He then suggested my\nhaving Lord Ashley, which I said I should like, as Treasurer or\nComptroller. Soon after this Sir Robert said: 'Now, about the Ladies,'\nupon which I said I could _not_ give up _any_ of my Ladies, and\nnever had imagined such a thing. He asked if I meant to retain _all_.\n'_All_,' I said. 'The Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of the\nBedchamber?' I replied, '_All_,'--for he said they were the wives\nof the opponents of the Government, mentioning Lady Normanby in\nparticular as one of the late Ministers' wives. I said that would not\ninterfere; that I never talked politics with them, and that they\nwere related, many of them, to Tories, and I enumerated those of my\nBedchamber women and Maids of Honour; upon which he said he did not\nmean _all_ the Bedchamber women and _all_ the Maids of Honour, he\nmeant the Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of the Bedchamber; to\nwhich I replied _they_ were of more consequence than the others, and\nthat I could _not_ consent, and that it had never been done before. He\nsaid I was a Queen Regnant, and that made the difference. 'Not here,'\nI said--and I maintained my right. Sir Robert then urged it upon\n_public grounds only_, but I said here I could not consent. He then\nbegged to be allowed to consult with the Duke upon such an important\nmatter. I expressed a wish also to see the Duke, if Sir Robert\napproved, which he said he did, and that he would return with the\nDuke, if I would then be prepared for the decision, which I said I\nwould. Well,\" I continued, \"the Duke and Sir Robert returned soon, and\nI first saw the Duke, who talked first of his being ready to take the\npost of Secretary for Foreign Affairs, which I had pressed Peel\nto urge on him (the Duke having first wished to be in the Cabinet,\nwithout accepting office), and the Duke said, 'I am able to do\nanything,' for I asked him if it would not be too much for him. Then\nI told him that I had been very well satisfied with Sir Robert\nyesterday, and asked the Duke if Sir Robert had told him what had\npassed about the Ladies. He said he had, and then I repeated all my\narguments, and the Duke his; but the Duke and Sir Robert differed\nconsiderably on two points. The Duke said the _opinions_ of the Ladies\nwere nothing, but it was the _principle_, whether the Minister could\nremove the Ladies or not, and that he (the Duke) had understood it was\nstated in the Civil List Bill, 'that the _Ladies were instead of the\nLords_,' which is quite false, and I told the Duke that there were not\n_twelve Lords_, as the expense _with the Ladies_ would have been too\ngreat.\" Lord Melbourne said: \"There you had the better of him,\nand what did he say?\" \"Not much,\" I replied. I repeated many of my\narguments, all which pleased Lord Melbourne, and which he agreed to,\namongst others, that I said to the Duke, Was Sir Robert so weak that\n_even_ the Ladies must be of his opinion? The Duke denied that. The\nDuke then took my decision to Sir Robert, who was waiting in the next\nroom; after a few minutes Sir Robert returned. After stopping a\nfew minutes, as I have already stated, Sir Robert went to see his\ncolleagues, and returned at five: said he had consulted with those who\nwere to have been his colleagues, and that they agreed that, with\nthe probability of being beat the first night about the Speaker, and\nbeginning with a Minority in the House of Commons, that unless\nthere was _some_ (_all_ the Officers of State and Lords I gave up)\ndemonstration of my confidence, and if I retained all my Ladies\nthis would not be, \"they agreed unanimously they could not go on.\" I\nreplied I would reflect, that I felt certain I should not change my\nmind, but that I should do nothing in a hurry, and would write him my\ndecision either that evening or the next morning. He said, meanwhile,\nhe would suspend all further proceedings.\n\"_11th May 1839._\n\"... This is the sum of the whole affair. Sir R. Peel could\n    not admit that broad principle that all were to remain.\n    Lady Normanby (whom the Queen particularly wishes for), for\n    instance, the wife of the very Minister whose measures have\n    been the cause of the change, two sisters of Lord Morpeth, the\n    sisters-in-law of Lord John Russell, the daughter of the Privy\n    Seal and the Chancellor of the Exchequer....\n\"Her Majesty's ball last night was, I am told, rather dull,\n    though she herself seemed in high spirits, as if she were\n    pleased at retaining her Ministers.

The march of the whole affair is\nvery clear and fair, and does you _great credit_....

You\nhave the great merit, for which you cannot be too much praised, of\nbeing _extremely honest_ and honourable in your dealings. If you had\nkept Peel, you would have acted honestly by him, without any Lady's\nhaving a chance of doing him a bad turn. When he asked the measure\nas an expression of your great confidence in him, it was not fair,\nbecause _you_ had not wished to take him; he was forced upon you, and\ntherefore, even if you had granted his request, nobody would have seen\nin it a proof of your confidence in him, but rather a sacrifice to a\nfar-stretched pretence.\nBesides, that he was to have encountered difficulties as a Minister\nwas partly the consequence of the policy of his party, and you were\nnot bound to give him any assistance beyond what he had a right to ask\nas a Minister. I was sure that Lord Melbourne would give you both the\nfairest and the most honourable advice in this painful crisis. He was\nkind enough last year to speak to me on the subject, and I could but\napprove what he said on the subject. Altogether, keeping now your\nold Ministers, you will have reason to congratulate yourself on the\nresult; it is likely to strengthen them, by showing the Radicals what\nmay be the consequences.\nRumour spoke of their wishing to add some Radicals to the Cabinet;\nI don't see that they could improve the Ministry by it, which is\nperfectly well composed as it is at present, and new elements often\nhave a dissolving effect.

What renders the thing very\ndifficult, in my opinion, is that in a country like France, and with\nso many Ministerial difficulties, the King to the _last hour_ will\nhardly know if he can undertake the thing. As, however, the first\nobject is to know your will, he begged me to ascertain that, and to\ntell you that if you had the _smallest objection_ you would not be\ncarried away by the apprehension of hurting him by telling me honestly\nthat you did _not_ see how the affair could be arranged, but to speak\nout, that he knew enough how often objections may arise, and that even\nwith himself he could only be sure of the thing at the last moment.",

Lord\nMelbourne has acted in this business, as he has always done towards\nme, with the greatest kindness and affection.\nWe also think it better, and Albert quite approves of it, that\nwe should be married very soon after Parliament meets, about the\nbeginning of February; and indeed, loving Albert as I do, I cannot\nwish it should be delayed. My feelings are a _little_ changed, I must\nsay, since last Spring, when I said I couldn't _think_ of marrying for\n_three or four years_; but seeing Albert has changed all this.\nPray, dearest Uncle, forward these two letters to Uncle Ernest\n(to whom I beg you will enjoin _strict_ secrecy, and explain these\ndetails, which I have not time to do) and to faithful Stockmar.\nI think you might tell Louise of it, but none of her family. I should\nwish to keep the dear young gentlemen here till the end of next month.\nErnest's sincere pleasure gave me great delight. He does so adore\ndearest Albert. Ever, dearest Uncle, your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

    "body": "MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--Nothing could have given me greater pleasure\nthan your dear letter. I had, when I saw your decision, almost the\nfeeling of old Zacharias--\"Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart\nin peace\"! Your choice had been for these last years my conviction of\nwhat might and would be _best_ for your happiness; and just because I\nwas convinced of it, and knowing how _strangely_ fate often _deranges_\nwhat one tries to bring about as being the best plan one could fix\nupon, _the maximum of a good arrangement_, I feared that it would\n_not_ happen. In your position, which may and will, perhaps, become\nin future even more difficult in a political point of view, _you could\nnot exist_ without having a _happy_ and an _agreeable int\u00e9rieur_.\nAnd I am much deceived--which I think I am not--or you will find\nin Albert just the very qualities and dispositions which are\nindispensable for your happiness, and _which will suit your own\ncharacter, temper, and mode of life_. You say most amiably that you\nconsider it a sacrifice on the part of Albert. This is true in many\npoints, because his position will be a difficult one; but much, I may\nsay _all_, will depend on your affection for him. If _you love him,\nand are kind to him_, he will easily bear the burthen of the position;\nand there is a steadiness and at the same time cheerfulness in his\ncharacter which will facilitate this. I think your plans excellent.\nIf Parliament had been called at an unusual time it would make them\nuncomfortable, and if, therefore, they receive the communication at\nthe opening of the Session, it will be best. The marriage, as you say,\nmight then follow as closely as possible.\nLord Melbourne has shown himself the _amiable_ and _excellent_ man I\nalways took him for. Another man in his position, instead of _your_\nhappiness, might have merely looked to his own personal views and\nimaginary interests. Not so our good friend; he saw what was best _for\nyou_, and I feel it deeply to his praise.\nYour keeping the cousins next month with you strikes me as a very good\nplan. It will even show that you had sufficient opportunity of judging\nof Albert's character....\nOn the 22nd, Prince Metternich came to see me. He was very kind, and\ntalked most confidentially about political affairs, particularly the\nOriental concerns. M. de Brunnow had been with him. The short of\nhis views is this: he wishes that the Powers could be _unanimous_,\nas he sees in this the best chance of avoiding measures of violence\nagainst the Pasha of Egypt, which he considers _dangerous_, either as\n_not_ sufficiently effective, or of a nature to bring on complications\nmost earnestly to be avoided, such as making use of Russian troops.\nAustria naturally would like to bring about the best possible\narrangement for the Porte, but it will adhere to any arrangement or\nproposition which can be agreed upon by England and France. He is,\nhowever, positive that Candia must be given back to the Porte, its\nposition being too threatening, and therefore constantly alarming the\nPorte. He made me write the import of our conversation to King Louis\nPhilippe, which I did send after him to Frankfort, where he was to\nforward it to Paris. Perhaps you will have the goodness to communicate\nthis political scrap to good Lord Melbourne with my best regards. He\nspoke in praise of Lord Beauvale. The Prince is better, but grown\nvery old and looking tired. It gave me great pleasure to see him\nagain.\nI drink the waters now four days, and can therefore not yet judge of\ntheir good or bad effects. My palpitations are rather increased here;\nif my stupid heart will get diseased I shall soon be departing for\nsome other world. I would it could be soon then.\nTill further orders I shall say nothing to your Mother, Charles, or\nFeodore.\nNow I will conclude with my best blessings, and remain, my dearest and\nmost beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

I was sure\nyou would be satisfied and pleased with our proceedings.\nBefore I proceed further, I wish just to mention one or two\nalterations in the plan of announcing the event.\nAs Parliament has _nothing_ whatever to say respecting the marriage,\ncan neither approve nor disapprove it (I mean in a manner which might\n_affect_ it), it is now proposed that, as soon as the cousins are gone\n(which they now intend to do on the 12th or 14th of November, as time\npresses), I should assemble all the Privy Councillors and announce to\nthem my intention....\nOh! dear Uncle, I _do_ feel so happy!

I cannot bear to part from him, for we\nspend such happy, delightful hours together.\nPoor Ernest has been suffering since Wednesday last with the jaundice,\nwhich is very distressing and troublesome, though not alarming.... I\nlove him dearly too, and look upon him quite as a brother.\nWhat you say about Lord Melbourne has given me great pleasure; it is\nvery just and very true.

He desires me to say that he is deeply\nsensible of your good opinion, and that he can have no other object\nthan that which he considers best to secure my happiness, which is\nclosely connected with the well-being of the country.\nI am glad you saw Prince Metternich, and that you were satisfied with\nthe interview.\nI hope and trust you may derive much benefit from your stay at\nWiesbaden.

    "body": "MY MOST BELOVED VICTORIA,--Your Uncle has already told you, I trust,\nwith what feelings of deep affection and gratitude I received the so\n_interesting_ and _important_ communication which you permitted him\nto make to me; but I was longing for an opportunity to speak to you\nmyself of the great subject which fills now our hearts, and to tell\nyou how very grateful I have been, I am, and will ever be, for the\nconfidence and trust which you so kindly placed in me. All I can\nsay is that you did full justice to my feelings, for _nothing_ could\ninterest _more_ my heart than _your_ marriage, my most dearly loved\nVictoria, and I could not have heard even of that of Cl\u00e9mentine with\n_more_ anxious affection and sisterly love. I cannot really tell you\n_with words_ how deeply and strongly I was moved and affected by the\ngreat news itself, and by your dear, unaffected, confiding, happy\nletter. When I received it I could do nothing but cry, and say\ninternally, \"May God bless her now and ever!\" Ah! may God bless you,\nmy most beloved Victoria! may He shower on you His best blessings,\nfulfil _all_ your heart's wishes and hopes, and let you enjoy for\n_many, many years_ the happiness which the dearest ties of affection\n_alone_ can give, and which is the only _real_ one, the only worthy of\nthe name in this uncertain and transitory world!\nI have seen much of dear Albert two years ago, I have watched him, as\nyou may well think, with particular care, attention, and interest, and\nalthough he was very young then, I am well convinced that he is not\nonly fit for the situation which he is now called to fulfil, but, what\nis still more important in my eyes, that he has _all those qualities_\nof the heart and the mind which can give and ensure happiness. I think\neven that his disposition is particularly well calculated to suit\nyours, and I am fully confident that you will be both happy together.\nWhat you tell me of your fear of not being worthy of him, and able to\nmake him sufficiently happy, is for me but a proof more of it. Deep\naffection makes us always diffident and _very humble_. Those that we\nlove stand so high in our own esteem, and are in our opinion so much\nabove us and all others that we naturally feel unworthy of them and\nunequal to the task of making them happy: but there is, I think, a\nmingled charm in this feeling, for although we regret not to be\nwhat we should wish to be for them, feeling and acknowledging the\nsuperiority of those we love and must always love and respect, is a\ngreat satisfaction, and an increasing and everlasting one. You will\nfeel it, I am sure, as well as I do....\nYou will excuse my blots and hurried scribbling when I will tell you\nthat in order to profit of the private messenger which goes to-morrow\nmorning I write to you at ten in the evening, a thing quite unusual\nfor me, and even rather forbidden: but after having been deprived of\nexpending my heart for so many days, I could not _not_ avail myself of\nthe present opportunity. When I write to you by the ordinary messenger\nI will continue to be _silent_; but I trust you will permit me to\nsay some time a word, when a safe opportunity presents itself, for my\nheart is with you more than I can tell. I would that I could see you,\nwhen it could be, for an hour. I remain, my most beloved Victoria,\never and ever your most affectionate\nLOUISE.",

I had written less of late, because I thought you\noccupied more agreeably than to read my letters. I have on purpose\nkept back a courier, to be able to send you the latest news from here\nof M. Albert. The young people arrived here only on the 20th, in the\nmorning, having very kindly stopped at Bonn. I find them looking well,\nparticularly Albert; it proves that happiness is an excellent remedy,\nand keeps people in better health than any other. He is much attached\nto you, and moved when he speaks of you. He is, besides, in great\nspirits and gaiety, and full of fun; he is a very amiable companion.\nConcerning the peerage, that is a matter to be considered at any\ntime; the only reason why I do wish it is, that Albert's foreignership\nshould disappear as much as possible. I have, in different\ncircumstances to be sure, suffered greatly from my having declined\nconditionally the peerage when it was offered me in 1816.

    "body": "As to your wish about your gentlemen, my dear Albert, I must tell you\nquite honestly that it will not do. You may entirely rely upon me that\nthe people who will be about you will be absolutely pleasant people,\nof high standing and good character. _These gentlemen will not be in\ncontinual attendance on you; only on great occasions, and to accompany\nyou when you go anywhere, and to dinners, etc. Seymour is your\nconfidential attendant, and also Schenk and Anson, whom Lehzen\nhas written to you about._\n_Old Sir George Anson has been told of your gracious wish to have him\nas Groom of the Bedchamber and is delighted._\n_I_ can only have _Lords_, and they will not be _Peers_, but _Lords_,\nthe eldest sons of Dukes or Marquesses, or Earls (Counts), and who as\nfar as possible are not in Parliament, for then they need not change,\n_but your people are appointed by you and not by me (nominally), and\ntherefore, unless they were to vote against my Government (which would\nbe awkward), they need not change. You may rely upon my care that you\nshall have proper people, and not idle and not too young, and Lord\nMelbourne has already mentioned several to me who would be very\nsuitable...._\nI have received to-day an ungracious letter from Uncle Leopold. He\nappears to me to be nettled because I no longer ask for his advice,\nbut dear Uncle is given to believe that he must rule the roast\neverywhere. However, that is not a necessity. As he has written to\nMelbourne, Melbourne will reply to him on every point, and will also\ntell him that Stockmar ought to come here as soon as possible to\narrange everything about the treaty. That will be a very good thing,\nbecause Stockmar understands all English things so well.\nThe _Second_, as you always called Palmerston, is to be married within\nthe next few days to Lady Cowper, the sister of my Premier (_Primus_);\nI have known this for a long time, but Melbourne asked me not to tell\nit to any one. They are, both of them, above fifty, and I think that\nthey are quite right so to act, because Palmerston, since the death\nof his sisters, is quite alone in the world, and _Lady C._ is a very\nclever woman, and _much_ attached to him; still, I feel sure it will\nmake you smile.\n(_Continued on the 9th_).--To-day I have had a _Conseil_, and then I\nknighted the Mayor of Newport (who distinguished himself so much\nin that _riot of the Chartists_); he is a very timid, modest man,\nand was very happy when I told him orally how exceedingly satisfied I\nam with his conduct.... The officers have been rewarded too.... I am\nplaguing you already with tiresome politics, but you will in that find\na proof of my [confidence] love, because I must share with you\neverything that rejoices me, everything that vexes or grieves me, and\nI am certain you will take your part in it....\nTo-day I saw Lord William Russell--you know him, don't you? I forgot\nto tell you that you will have a _great Officer of State_ at the head\nof your Household, who is called the _Groom of the Stole_; it is a\nposition in the Court for prestige only, without any business; he will\nbe a _Peer_....\n(_Continued 10th December_).--I am very impatient at your bust not\nhaving yet arrived; the Duchess of Sutherland wrote to me she had seen\nit in Rome, and it was so beautiful!...\nWho has made the little copy which you sent me, and who the original?\nFeodore writes to me so much about you....\nWe expect Queen Adelaide to-day, who will stay here until the day\nafter to-morrow. Melbourne has asked me to enquire of you whether\nyou know Lord Grosvenor? He is the eldest son of the Marquis\nof Westminster, and does not belong to any party; he is not in\nParliament. He is very pleasant, speaks German very well, and has been\na good deal on the Continent. If he accepts, he might be one of\nyour _gentlemen_. _Lord Melbourne is particularly desirous of doing\neverything that is most agreeable to you._ I have a request to make,\ntoo, viz., that you will appoint poor Clark your _physician_; you need\nnot consult him unless you wish it. It is only an honorary title, and\nwould make him very happy....",

    "body": "MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I lived in the hope of receiving some letters\nfor you from Albert, but nothing is arrived to-day. Your dear long\nletter gave me great pleasure. Before I answer some parts of it, I\nwill say a few words on Lord Melbourne's letter. Perhaps you will be\nso good to tell him that it gratified me much. It is the letter of an\nhonest and an amiable statesman, practical and straightforward. In\nthe omission of the word \"Protestant\" he was probably right, and it is\nequally probable that they would have abused him--maybe even more if\nhe had put it in. There is only this to say, however: the Ernestine\nbranch of the Saxon family has been, there is no doubt, the real cause\nof the establishment of Protestantism in Germany, and consequently in\ngreat parts of Northern Europe. This same line became a martyr to that\ncause, and was deprived of almost all its possessions in consequence\nof it.\nRecently there have been two cases of Catholic marriages, but the main\nbranch has remained, and is, in fact, very sincerely Protestant. Both\nErnest and Albert are much attached to it, and when deviations took\nplace they were connected more with new branches transplanted out of\nthe parent soil than with what more properly must be considered as the\nreigning family.\nThe Peerage question may remain as it is, but it will not be denied\nthat the great object must be to make Albert as English as possible,\nand that nothing will render this more difficult than a foreign\nname....\nI shall be most happy to see poor Charlotte's bust in the Gallery at\nWindsor, and it is kind of you to have had the thought. She was a high\nand noble-minded creature, and her affection and kindness for me\nvery great. She had placed the most unbounded confidence in me; our\nprinciple had been never to let a single day pass over any little\nsubject of irritation. The only subjects of that sort we had were\nabout the family, particularly the Regent, and then the old Queen\nCharlotte. Now I must conclude with my best love. Ever, my dearest\nVictoria, your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

With regard to your\nlast objection, that it would make you a party man if you took the\nSecretary of the Prime Minister as your Treasurer, I do not agree in\nit; for, though I am very anxious you should not appear to belong to a\nParty, still it is necessary that your Household should not form a too\nstrong contrast to mine, else they will say, \"Oh, we know the Prince\nsays he belongs to no party, but we are sure he is a Tory!\" Therefore\nit is also necessary that it should appear that you went with me in\nhaving some of your people who are staunch Whigs; but Anson is not\nin Parliament, and never was, and therefore he is not a violent\npolitician. Do not think because I urge this, Lord M. prefers it; on\nthe contrary, he never urged it, and I only do it as I know it is for\nyour own good._ You will pardon this long story. _It will also not do\nto wait till you come to appoint all your people.

I must confess that I never saw anything _so\ndisgraceful_ than the discussion and vote in the Commons. The whole\nmode and way in which those who opposed the grant treated the\nquestion was so extremely _vulgar_ and _disrespectful_, that I cannot\ncomprehend the Tories. The men who uphold the dignity of the Crown to\ntreat their Sovereign in such a manner, on such an occasion! Even in\nprivate life the most sour and saturnine people relax and grow gay\nand mildly disposed on occasions like this. Clearly, as you are Queen\nRegnant, Albert's position is to all intents and purposes that of a\nmale Queen Consort, and the same privileges and charges ought to be\nattached to it which were attached to Queen Adelaide's position. The\ngiving up the income which the Queen-Dowager came into, and which I\nhope and trust Albert would never have, or have had, any chance of\nhaving had himself, was in reality giving up a thing which _custom_\nhad sanctioned. That Prince George of Denmark was considered to\nbe in the same position as a Queen Consort there can be, I think,\nno doubt about, and when one considers the immense difference in the\nvalue of money then and now, it renders matters still more striking.\nI must say such conduct in Parliament I did _not expect_, and the\nless when I consider that your Civil List was rather curtailed than\notherwise, perhaps not quite fairly. I rejoice to think that I induced\nLord Melbourne to propose to you not to accede to the giving up of\nthe Duchy of Lancaster. Parliament did not deserve it, and by good\nmanagement I think something may be made of it.\nAnother thing which made me think that Parliament would have acted\nwith more decency, is that I return to the country now near \u00a340,000\na year, _not because_ I thought my income _too large_, as worthy Sir\nRobert Peel said, but from motives of political delicacy, which at\nleast might be acknowledged on such occasions. I was placed by my\nmarriage treaty in the position of a Princess of Wales, which in\nreality it was, though not yet by law, there existing a possibility of\na Prince of Wales as long as George IV. lived. I can only conclude by\ncrying _shame, shame_!...\nI hope and trust you will not be too much worried with all these\nunpleasant things, and that Albert will prove a comforter and support\nto you. And so good-bye for to-day. Ever, my dearest Victoria, your\ndevoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

    "body": "MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I received yesterday a most kind and dear letter\nfrom your august hands. Charles, who wanted to cross yesterday,\nwill have had very bad weather. He _is_ prepared not to make too long\na stay in England. He dined here on the 19th. Louise was prepared\nto come to dinner, but was not quite equal to it; she therefore came\nafter it. He came also to see me on the 20th, before his departure for\nOstende. It is very gracious of you to have given him subsidies, but\nin fact poor Feo stands more in need of it. She really is too poor;\nwhen one thinks that they have but \u00a3600 a year, and that large\ncastles, etc., are to be kept up with it, one cannot conceive how they\nmanage it. It was a very generous feeling which prompted you to see\nMrs Norton, and I have been too much her friend to find fault with it.\nTrue it is that Norton was freely accepted by her, but she was very\npoor, and could therefore hardly venture to refuse him. Many people\nwill flirt with a clever, handsome, but poor girl, though not marry\nher--besides, the idea of having old Shery for a grandfather had\nnothing very captivating. A very unpleasant husband Norton certainly\nwas, and one who had little tact. I can well believe that she was much\nfrightened, having so many eyes on her, some of which, perhaps, not\nwith the most amiable expression.\nI was delighted to learn that you meant to visit poor Claremont, and\nto pass there part of your precious birthday. Claremont is the place\nwhere in younger days you were least plagued, and generally I saw you\nthere in good spirits. You will also _nolens volens_ be compelled to\nthink of me, and maybe of poor Charlotte.\nThis gives me an opening for saying a few words on this subject. I\nfound several times that some people had given you the impression that\npoor Charlotte had been hasty and violent even to imperiousness and\n_rudeness_. I can you assure that it was _not so_; she was quick, and\neven violent, but I never have seen anybody so open to conviction, and\nso fair and candid when wrong. The proverb says, and not without some\ntruth, that ladies come always back to the first words, to avoid any\nsymptom of having been convinced. Generous minds, however, do not do\nthis; they fight courageously their battles, but when they clearly see\nthat they are wrong, and that the reasons and arguments submitted to\nthem are _true_, they frankly admit the truth. Charlotte had eminently\nthis disposition; besides, she was so anxious to please me, that often\nshe would say: \"Let it be as it may; provided you wish it, I will\ndo it.\" I always answered: \"I never want anything for myself; when I\npress something on you, it is from a conviction that it is for your\ninterest and for your good.\" I know that you have been told that she\nordered everything in the house and liked to show that she was the\nmistress. It was not so. On the contrary, her pride was to make\nme appear to my best advantage, and even to display respect and\nobedience, when I least wanted it from her. She would almost\nexaggerate the feeling, to show very clearly that she considered me as\nher lord and master.\nAnd on the day of the marriage, as most people suspected her of a very\ndifferent disposition, everybody was struck with the manner in which\nshe pronounced the promise of obedience. I must say that I was much\nmore the master of the house than is generally the case in private\nlife. Besides, there was something generous and royal in her mind\nwhich alone would have prevented her doing anything vulgar or\nill-bred. What rendered her sometimes a little violent was a slight\ndisposition to jealousy. Poor Lady Maryborough, at all times some\ntwelve or fifteen years older than myself, but whom I had much known\nin 1814, was once much the cause of a fit of that description. I told\nher it was quite childish, but she said, \"it is not, because she is a\nvery coquettish, dissipated woman.\" The most difficult task I had was\nto change her manners; she had something brusque and too rash in her\nmovements, which made the Regent quite unhappy, and which sometimes\nwas occasioned by a struggle between shyness and the necessity of\nexerting herself. I had--I may say so without seeming to boast--the\nmanners of the best society of Europe, having early moved in it, and\nbeen rather what is called in French _de la fleur des pois_. A good\njudge I therefore was, but Charlotte found it rather hard to be so\nscrutinised, and grumbled occasionally how I could so often find fault\nwith her.\nNothing perhaps speaks such volumes as the _positive fact_ of her\nmanners getting _quite changed_ within a year's time, and that to\nthe openly pronounced satisfaction of the very fastidious and not\nover-partial Regent. To explain how it came that manners were a little\nodd in England, it is necessary to remember that England had been for\nmore than ten years completely cut off from the rest of the world....\nWe have bitter cold weather which has given colds to both the\nchildren. Uncle Ferdinand  is now only arriving _si dice_ on\nSunday next. He has been robbed of 15,000 francs in his own room _au\nPalais-Royal_, which is very unpleasant for all parties.\nMy letter is so long that I must haste to conclude it, remaining ever,\nmy beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.\nMy love to Alberto.",

    "body": "_Lord Melbourne._--\"I have spoken to the Queen, who says the Prince\ncomplains of a want of confidence on trivial matters, and on all\nmatters connected with the politics of this country. She said it\nproceeded entirely from indolence; she knew it was wrong, but when she\nwas with the Prince she preferred talking upon other subjects. I told\nHer Majesty that she should try and alter this, and that there was\nno objection to her conversing with the Prince upon any subject she\npleased. My impression is that the chief obstacle in Her Majesty's\nmind is the fear of difference of opinion, and she thinks that\ndomestic harmony is more likely to follow from avoiding subjects\nlikely to create difference. My own experience leads me to think that\nsubjects between man and wife, even where difference is sure to ensue,\nare much better discussed than avoided, for the latter course is sure\nto beget distrust. I do not think that the Baroness is the cause\nof this want of openness, though her name to me is never mentioned by\nthe Queen.\"\n_Baron Stockmar._--\"I wish to have a talk with you. The Prince leans\nmore on you than any one else, and gives you his entire confidence;\nyou are honest, moral, and religious, and will not belie that trust.\nThe Queen has not started upon a right principle. She should by\ndegrees impart everything to him, but there is danger in his wishing\nit all at once. A case may be laid before him; he may give some\ncrude and unformed opinion; the opinion may be taken and the result\ndisastrous, and a forcible argument is thus raised against advice\nbeing asked for the future.\n\"The Queen is influenced more than she is aware of by the Baroness. In\nconsequence of that influence, she is not so ingenuous as she was two\nyears ago. I do not think that the withholding of her confidence does\nproceed wholly from indolence, though it may partly arise, as the\nPrince suggests, from the entire confidence which she reposes in her\npresent Ministers, making her inattentive to the plans and measures\nproposed, and thinking it unnecessary entirely to comprehend them; she\nis of necessity unable to impart their views and projects to him who\nought to be her friend and counsellor.\"",

In your good little heart I hope that it made you\nfeel grateful to God for a protection which was very signal. It does\ngood and is a consolation to think that matters are not _quite_ left\nto take care of _themselves_, but that an all-powerful Hand guides\nthem.\nLouise I told the affair mildly, as it might have made too great an\nimpression on her otherwise. She always feels so much for you and\nloves you so much, that she was rejoiced beyond measure that you\nescaped so well and took the thing with so much _courage_. That you\nhave shown _great fortitude_ is not to be doubted, and will make a\nvery great and good impression. I see that the general feeling is\nexcellent, but what a melancholy thing to see a young man, without\nprovocation, capable of such a diabolical act! That attempts of that\nsort took place against George III., and even George IV., one can\ncomprehend; but you have not only been extremely liberal, but in no\ninstance have you hitherto come into contact with any popular feeling\nor prejudice; besides, one should think that your being a lady would\nalone prevent such unmanly conduct. It shows what an effect bad\nexample and the bad press have. I am sure that this act is _une\nsingerie_ of what passes in France, that it is a fancy of some of\nthose societies _de Mort aux Rois et Souverains_, without knowing\nwherefore, merely as a sort of fashion....",

    "body": "MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--Your dear letter of the 19th greatly delighted\nme....\nLet me now add a few words on politics. The _secret_ way in which the\narrangement about the arbitration of the Turco-Egyptian affairs has\nbeen signed, the keeping out of France in an affair so _near_ it\nand touching its interests in various ways, has had here a very\n_disastrous_ effect. I cannot disguise from you that the\nconsequences may be very serious, and the more so as the Thiers\nMinistry is supported by the movement party, and as _reckless of\nconsequences_ as your own Minister for Foreign Affairs, even much more\nso, as Thiers himself would not be sorry to see everything existing\nupset. He is strongly impregnated with all the notions of fame and\nglory which belonged to part of the Republican and the Imperial times;\nhe would not even be much alarmed at the idea of a Convention ruling\nagain France, as he thinks that _he_ would be the _man to rule_ the\nAssembly, and has told me last year that he thinks it for France\nperhaps the _most powerful_ form of Government.\nThe mode in this affair ought to have been, as soon as the Four Powers\nhad agreed on a proposition, to communicate it officially to France,\nto join it. France had but two ways, either to join or to refuse\nits adhesion. If it had chosen the last, it would have been a free\ndecision on her part, and a secession which had nothing offensive in\nthe eyes of the nation.\nBut there is a material difference between leaving a company from\nmotives of one's own, or being _kicked out_ of it. I must beg you to\nspeak seriously to Lord Melbourne, who is the head of your Government,\non these important affairs; they may upset everything in Europe if the\nmistake is not corrected and moderated.\nI shall write again to you next Friday from hence, and on Saturday,\n1st August, we set off. Ever, my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

    "body": "MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I was most happy in receiving this morning per\nmessenger your dear little letter of the 15th, though it is grown a\nlittle elderly. The life one leads here is not favourable to writing,\nwhich, besides, is prohibited, and easily gives me palpitation enough\nto sing \"_di tanti palpiti!_\" I get up at half after six and begin to\ndrink this hot water; what with drinking and walking one comes to ten\no'clock or half after ten for breakfast. Then I read papers and such\nlike things. At one o'clock I have been generally bored with some\nvisit or other till two o'clock. I try to finish some writing, and\nthen I walk and ride out till dinner-time, generally at seven. In the\nevening I have written sometimes, but it certainly does one harm. You\nsee that there remains but little time for writing.\nI am most happy to find that you are well; the papers, which don't\nknow what to invent to lower the Funds, said that you had been unwell\non the 10th, which, God be praised! is not at all true.\nI pity poor Princess Augusta from all my heart. I am sure that if\nshe had in proper time taken care of herself she might have lived to\na great age. I have not time to-day to write at any length on the\npolitics of the day, but I am _far from thinking_ that the French\n_acted wisely_ in the Oriental affair. I must say that I think\nthe King _meant well_, but I should not have _abstained_ from the\nConference as he did, though, in France, interference with Mehemet Ali\nwas certainly not popular. In England much of the _fond_ is logical,\nbut the form towards France was, and is still, harsh and insulting. I\ndon't think France, which these ten years behaved well, and the poor\nKing, who was nearly murdered I don't remember how often, deserved\nto be treated so unkindly, and all that seemingly to please the great\nAutocrat. We must not forget what were the fruits of the _first_\nConvention of July 1828--I think the 16th or 26th of that month; I\nought to remember it, as I took its name in vain often enough in the\nGreek affair.\nThis first Convention brought about the battle of Navarino and the\nsecond campaign of the Russians, which ended with, in fact, the demise\nof the poor old Porte, the _Treaty of Adrianople_. Your Majesty\nwas then afflicted with the age of ten, in itself a good age, and may\nnot remember much about it except that in 1829 the affair about my\ngoing to Greece began, and that your affectionate heart took some\ninterest in that. Lord Melbourne, however, you _must encourage to\nspeak about this matter_. Canning's intention was this: he said we\nmust remain with Russia, and by this means _prevent_ mischief. The\nDuke of Wellington, who came to me shooting at Claremont in 1828,\nreally did cry, though he is not of a crying disposition, and said\n\"_by this Convention the Russians will have the power of doing all\nthey never would have dared to do single-handed_, and shielded by\nthis infernal Convention, it will not be in our power _to stop them_.\"\nRussia is again in this very snug and comfortable position, that\n_the special protection of the Porte_ is confided to its tender\nmercies--_la ch\u00e8vre gardant le chou_, the wolf the sheep, as I suppose\nI must not compare the Turcs to lambs. The Power which ruined the\nOttoman Empire, which since a hundred and forty years nearly _pared_\nit all round nearly in every direction, is to be the protector and\nguardian of that same empire; and we are told that it is the most\nscandalous calumny to suspect the Russians to have any other than the\nmost humane and disinterested views! \"_ainsi soit-il_,\" as the French\nsay at the end of their sermons. This part of the Convention of the\n15th of July 1840 strikes impartial people as strange, the more so\nas nothing lowers the Porte so much in the eyes of the few patriotic\nTurks who remain than the protection of the arch-enemy of the concern,\nRussia. I beg you to read this part of my letter to my good and dear\nfriend, Lord Melbourne, to whom I beg to be kindly remembered.",

I regret her _very, very_\nsincerely, though for herself we are all most thankful for the release\nof such unexampled sufferings, borne with such unexampled patience.\nAlmost the last thing she said when she was still conscious, the day\nbefore she died, was to Mr More (the apothecary), who wrote me every\nmorning a Report: \"Have you written to my darling?\" Is this not\ntouching? The Queen-Dowager had her hand in hers when she died, and\nclosed her eyes when all was over; all the Family were present.\nI have seen your letters to Palmerston, and his answer to you, and I\nalso send you a paper from Lord Melbourne. I assure you that I _do_\ngive these affairs my _most serious_ attention: it would be indeed\n_most_ desirable if France could _come back to us_, and I think what\nMetternich suggests very sagacious and well-judged. You must allow\nme to state that _France_ has _put herself_ into this unfortunate\nstate. _I_ know (as I saw _all_ the _papers_) how she was engaged\nto join us--and I know how strangely she refused; I know also, that\nFrance _agrees_ in the _principle_, but only doubts the _efficacy_ of\nthe measures. Where then is \"_La France outrag\u00e9e_\"? wherefore arm when\nthere is _no_ enemy? wherefore raise the war-cry? But this has been\n_done_, and has taken _more_ effect than I think the French Government\n_now_ like; and _now_ she has to undo all this and to calm the general\nagitation and excitement, which is not so easy. Still, though France\nis in the wrong, and _quite_ in the wrong, still _I_ am most anxious,\nas I am sure my Government also are, that France should be pacified\nand should again take her place amongst the five Powers.

    "body": "... There is an idea that Mehemet Ali suffers from what one calls _un\ncharbon_, a sort of dangerous ulcer which, with old people, is never\nwithout some danger. If this is true, it only shows how little one can\nsay that the Pashalik of Aleppo is to decide who is to be the master\nof the Ottoman Empire in Europe and Asia, the Sultan or Mehemet? It is\nhighly probable that if the old gentleman dies, his concern will go to\npieces; a division will be attempted by the children, but that in the\nEast hardly ever succeeds. There everything is personal, except the\nsort of Caliphate which the Sultan possesses, and when the man is\ngone, his empire _also goes_. Runjeet Singh is a proof of this;\nhis formidable power will certainly go to the dogs, though the Sikhs\nhave a social link which does not exist in the Egyptian concern. If we\nnow were to set everything in Europe on a blaze, have a war which may\nchange totally all that now exists, and in the midst of it we should\nhear that Mehemet is no more, and his whole _boutique_ broken up,\nwould it not be _really laughable_, if it was not _melancholy_? And\nstill the war _once raging_, it would no longer put a stop to it, but\ngo on for _other reasons_.\nI cannot understand what has rendered Palmerston so _extremely hostile\nto the King_ and Government of France. A _little civility_ would have\ngone a great way with the French; if in your Speech on the 11th of\nAugust some regret had been expressed, it would have greatly modified\nthe feelings of the French. But Palmerston _likes to put his foot on\ntheir necks_! _Now, no statesman must triumph over an enemy that is\nnot quite dead_, because people forget a real loss, a real misfortune,\nbut they won't forget _an insult_. Napoleon made great mistakes that\nway; he hated Prussia, insulted it on all occasions, but still _left\nit alive_. The consequence was that in 1813 they rose to a man in\nPrussia, even children and women took arms, not only because they had\nbeen injured, but because they had been treated with _contempt_ and\n_insulted_. I will here copy what the King wrote to me lately from\nParis:\n\"Vous ne vous faites pas d'id\u00e9e \u00e0 quel point l'approbation publique\nsoutient les armements, c'est universel. Je regrette que cela aille\nbien au-del\u00e0, car la fureur contre l'Angleterre s'accro\u00eet et un\ndes points que je regrette le plus, c'est que tout notre peuple est\npersuad\u00e9 que l'Angleterre veut r\u00e9duire la France _au rang de Puissance\nsecondaire_, et vous savez ce que c'est que l'orgueil national et la\nvanit\u00e9 de tous les peuples. Je crois donc bien urgent que la crise\nactuelle se termine bient\u00f4t pacifiquement. Plus je crois que l'union\nde l'Angleterre et de la France est la base du repos du monde, plue je\nregrette de voir susciter tant d'irritation entre nos deux Nations.\nLa question est de savoir ce que veut v\u00e9ritablement le Gouvernement\nAnglais. J'avoue que je ne suis pas sans crainte et sans inqui\u00e9tude \u00e0\ncet \u00e9gard quand je r\u00e9capitule dans ma t\u00eate tout ce que Lord Ponsonby\na fait pour l'allumer et tout ce qu'il fait encore. Je n'aurais aucune\ninqui\u00e9tude si je croyais que le Gouvernement suivrait la voix de\nsa Nation, et les v\u00e9ritables int\u00e9r\u00eats de son pays qui repoussent\nl'alliance Russe et indiquent celle de la France, ce qui est\ntout-\u00e0-fait conforme \u00e0 mes v[oe]ux personnels. Mais ma vieille\nexp\u00e9rience me rappelle ce que font les passions personnelles, qui\npr\u00e9dominent bien plus de nos jours que les v\u00e9ritables int\u00e9r\u00eats, et ce\nque peut le Gouvernement Anglais pour entra\u00eener son pays, et je\ncrains beaucoup l'art de la Russie ou plut\u00f4t de l'Empereur Nicolas\nde captiver, par les plus immenses flatteries, les Ministres Anglais,\npreuve Lord Durham. Or si ces deux Gouvernements veulent ou osent\nentreprendre _l'abaissement_ de la France, la guerre s'allumera, et\npour _mon compte alors je m'y_ jetterai _\u00e0 outrance_, mais si comme\nje l'esp\u00e8re encore, malgr\u00e9 mes soup\u00e7ons, ils ne veulent pas la guerre,\nalors l'affaire de l'Orient, s'arrangera \u00e0 l'amiable, et le cri de\ntoutes les Nations fera de nouveau justice de ces humeurs belliqueuses\net consolidera la paix g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, comme cela est arriv\u00e9 dans les\npremi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de mon r\u00e8gne.\"\nI think it right to give you this extract, as it is written from\nthe very bottom of the King's heart, and shows the way in which he\nconsiders the present position of affairs. Perhaps you will be so\nkind to read it or to let it be read by Lord Melbourne. It is\nthis _abaissement de la France_ which now sticks in their throats.\nChartres has quite the same feeling, and then the refrain is,\n_plut\u00f4t p\u00e9rir que de souffrir cette ignominie!_\nReally my paper is abominable, but it is a great shame that in the\nresidence of such a rich Prince nothing can be had.

    "body": "Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. ... All\nthe question at the Cabinet to-day as to whether we should write\na communication to France was fortunately put an end to by Guizot\ndesiring to see Palmerston in the morning and making a communication\nto him. This communication is very much in substance what Mr. Bulwer's\nnote had led us to expect. It is a strong condemnation of the act\nof the Porte depriving Mehemet Ali of the Government of Egypt,\nan expression of satisfaction at having already learned from Lord\nPalmerston and Count Apponyi that Austria and England are not\nprepared to consider this act as irrevocable, and a threat on the\npart of France that he considers the power of Mehemet Ali in Egypt a\nconstituent part of the balance of Europe, and that he cannot permit\nhim to be deprived of that province without interfering. It was\ndetermined that this intimation should be met in an amicable spirit,\nand that Lord Palmerston should see the Ministers of the other Powers\nand agree with them to acquaint the French that they with England\nwould use their good offices to induce the Porte not to insist upon\nthe deprivation of Mehemet Ali as far as Egypt is concerned. Lord\nMelbourne hopes that this transaction may lead to a general settlement\nof the whole question.\nLord Melbourne feels himself much fatigued to-night. Though better, he\nis yet far from well, and he knows by experience that this malady when\nonce it lays hold of him does not easily let go. It was so when he was\nyounger. He fears, therefore, that it will not be prudent for him to\nleave town so early as Monday, but will do so as soon as he can with\nsafety.",

He will go down to Windsor\nto-morrow, and your Majesty will then have an opportunity of speaking\nto him, upon which Lord Melbourne will write again to your Majesty.\nGuizot has been with Lord Melbourne this morning for the purpose of\nrepeating what he had before said to Palmerston, that the Note which\nhe delivered on Saturday was the result of a great effort made by the\nparty who are for peace, that it had been conquered against a strong\nopposition, that if it were not taken advantage of here now, it would\nnot be renewed, that the conduct of affairs in France would probably\nfall into the hands of the violent party, and that it would be no\nlonger possible to control the excited feelings of the people of\nFrance.\nThe worst is that Palmerston, and John Russell, with now the\ngreater part of the Cabinet, proceed upon principles, opinions, and\nexpectations which are entirely different from one another, and which\ntherefore necessarily lead to a different course of action. We are\nanxious to finish the business speedily, because we fear that there is\ndanger of the Government of France being forced into violent measures\nby popular outcry. Palmerston, on the contrary, thinks that there is\nno danger of war, that the French do not mean war, and that there is\nno feeling in France but what has been produced by the Ministry and\ntheir instruments the Press.\nWe are anxious that the opportunity should be seized now whilst we\nhave the appearance of success in Syria, not being at all confident of\nthe ultimate result. Palmerston, on the contrary, is so confident of\ncomplete success, that he wishes to delay concluding the affair until\nhe can have the benefit of the full advantages, which he anticipates,\nin the negotiation.\nWe should be too glad to see the matter settled, leaving Mehemet Ali\nin possession of Egypt.\nPalmerston has both the wish and the hope of getting him out of Egypt,\nas well as Syria.\nThese great differences of view, object, and expectation render it\ndifficult for those who hold them to pursue the same line of conduct.\nThere is also, as your Majesty knows, much suspicion, distrust and\nirritation, and all these circumstances throw great obstacles in the\nway of the progress of affairs, but Lord Melbourne hopes that they\nwill all be overcome, and that we shall arrive at a safe conclusion.",

Indeed, dearest Uncle, I have worked hard\nthis last week to bring about something conciliatory, and I hope and\ntrust I have succeeded. Lord Melbourne, who left Claremont on the\nsame day as we did, was confined to the house till yesterday, when he\narrived here, by a lumbago and bilious attack; but I had a constant\ncorrespondence with him on this unfortunate and alarming question, and\nhe is, I can assure you, fully aware of the danger, and as anxious as\nwe are to set matters right; and so is Lord John, and Palmerston, I\nhope, is getting more reasonable. They have settled in consequence of\nThiers' two despatches that Palmerston should write to Lord Ponsonby\nto urge the Porte _not_ to dispossess Mehemet Ali finally of Egypt,\nand I believe the other foreign Ministers at Constantinople will\nreceive similar instructions; this despatch Palmerston will send to\nGranville (to-night, I believe) to be communicated to Thiers, and _I_\nhave made Palmerston _promise_ to put into the despatch to Granville\n\"that it would be a source of great satisfaction to England, if this\nwould be the cause of bringing back France to that alliance (with\nthe other Four Powers) from which we had seen her depart with so much\nregret.\" I hope this will have a good effect. Now, in _my_ humble\nopinion (but this I say of myself and without anybody's knowledge),\nif France, upon this, were to make some sort of advance, and were to\n_cease arming_, I think all would do; for you see, if France goes on\narming, we shall hardly be justified in not doing the same, and that\nwould be very bad. Couldn't you suggest this to the King and Thiers,\nas of yourself? My anxiety is great for the return of amity and\nconcord, I can assure you. I think our child ought to have besides its\nother names those of _Turco Egypto_, as we think of nothing else!\nI had a long talk with Palmerston on Wednesday, and also with J.\nRussell.\nI hope I have done good. The Dutch don't like the abdication. I'm so\nsorry for poor little Paris!\nPray excuse this dreadful scrawl, but I am so hurried. Ever your\ndevoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

You know well that no personal\ninterest guides me in my exertions; I am in fact bored with being\nhere, and shall ever regret to have remained in these regions, when I\nmight so easily have gone myself to the Orient, the great object of my\npredilection.\nI never shall advise anything which would be against the interests and\nhonour of yourself, your Government, or your country, in which I have\nso great a stake myself. The great thing now is _not to refuse to\nnegotiate_ with France, even if it should end in nothing. Still for\nthe King Louis Philippe there is an _immense strength_ and facility in\nthat word \"_nous n\u00e9gocions_\"; with this he may get over the opening of\nthe session, and this once done, one may hope to come to a conclusion.\nSince I wrote to Lord Melbourne to-day, I have received a letter\nfrom the King, of the 19th, _i.e._ yesterday, in which he tells me,\n\"_Pourvu qu'il y ait, pour commencer, des n\u00e9gociations, cela me donne\nune grande force._\"\nI have written yesterday to him most fully a letter he may show Thiers\nalso concerning the armaments. I think that my arguments will make\nsome impression on Thiers. The King writes me word that by dint of\ngreat exertion he had brought Thiers to be more moderate. If it was\npossible to bring France and Mehemet Ali to agree to the greatest part\nof the Treaty, it will be worth while for everybody to consent. The\nway to bring France to join in some arrangement, and to take the\nengagement to compel Mehemet to accept it, would be the best practical\nway to come to a conclusion. It is probable, though I know nothing\nabout it in any positive way, that the efforts of getting possession\nof Syria will fail, if the country itself does not take up arms on a\nlarge scale, which seems not to be believed.\nTo conclude then my somewhat hurried argumentation, the greatest\nthing is to negotiate. The negotiation cannot now have the effect of\nweakening the execution as that goes on, and it may have the advantage\nof covering the non-success if that should take place, which is at\nall events possible if not probable. May I beg you to read these few\nconfused words to Lord Melbourne as a supplement of my letter to him.\nDarmes says that if Chartres had been with the King, he would not\nhave fired, but that his reason for wishing to kill the King was his\nconviction that one could not hope for war till he was dead.\nIt is really melancholy to see the poor King taking this _acharnement_\nvery much to heart, and upon my word, the other Powers of Europe owe\nit to themselves and to him to do everything to ease and strengthen\nhis awful task.\nWhat do you say to poor Christina's departure? I am sorry for it,\nand for the poor children. She is believed to be very rich.\nNow I must conclude, but not without thanking you once more for your\n_great and most laudable exertions_, and wishing you every happiness,\nwhich you so _much deserve_. Ever, my most beloved Victoria, your\ndevoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

But that Party will not revenge themselves on the Four Powers\nby making a revolution in France, and they are enlightened enough to\nsee that France cannot revenge herself by making war against the Four\nPowers, who are much stronger than she is.\n... But your Majesty may be assured that there is in France an immense\nmass of persons, possessed of property, and engaged in pursuits of\nindustry, who are decidedly adverse to unnecessary war, and determined\nto oppose revolution. And although those persons have not hitherto\ncome prominently forward, yet their voice would have made itself\nheard, when the question of peace or unprovoked war came practically\nto be discussed.\nWith regard to internal revolution, there is undoubtedly in France a\nlarge floating mass of Republicans and Anarchists, ready at any moment\nto make a disturbance if there was no strong power to resist them; but\nthe persons who would lose by convulsion are infinitely more numerous,\nand the National Guard of Paris, consisting of nearly 60,000 men,\nare chiefly persons of this description, and are understood to be\ndecidedly for internal order, and for external peace.\nIt is very natural that the French Government, after having failed to\nextort concessions upon the Turkish Question, by menaces of foreign\nwar, should now endeavour to obtain those concessions, by appealing\nto fears of another kind, and should say that such concessions are\nnecessary in order to prevent revolution in France; but Viscount\nPalmerston would submit to your Majesty his deep conviction that\nthis appeal is not better founded than the other, and that a firm and\nresolute perseverance on the part of the Four Powers, in the measures\nwhich they have taken in hand, will effect a settlement of the affairs\nof Turkey, which will afford great additional security for the future\npeace of Europe, without producing in the meantime either war _with_\nFrance, or revolution _in_ France.\nFrance and the rest of Europe are entirely different now from what\nthey were in 1792. The French nation is as much interested now to\navoid further revolution, as it was interested then in ridding itself,\nby any means, of the enormous and intolerable abuses which then\nexisted. France then imagined she had much to gain by foreign war;\nFrance now knows she has everything to lose by foreign war.\nEurope then (at least the Continental States) had also a strong desire\nto get rid of innumerable abuses which pressed heavily upon the people\nof all countries. Those abuses have now in general been removed; the\npeople in many parts of Germany have been admitted, more or less, to\na share in the management of their own affairs. A German feeling and\na spirit of nationality has sprung up among all the German people, and\nthe Germans, instead of receiving the French as Liberators, as many\nof them did in 1792-1793, would now rise as one man to repel a hateful\ninvasion. Upon all these grounds Viscount Palmerston deems it his duty\nto your Majesty to express his strong conviction that the appeals made\nto your Majesty's good feelings by the King of the French, upon the\nscore of the danger of revolution in France, unless concessions are\nmade to the French Government, have no foundation in truth, and are\nonly exertions of skilful diplomacy.\nViscount Palmerston has to apologise to your Majesty for having\ninadvertently written a part of this memorandum upon a half-sheet of\npaper. And he would be glad if, without inconvenience to your Majesty,\nhe could be enabled to read to the Cabinet to-morrow the accompanying\ndespatches from Lord Granville.",

The Queen\nwill just make a few observations upon various points in it, to which\nshe would wish to draw Lord Palmerston's attention. The Queen does so\nwith strict impartiality, having had ample opportunities of hearing\nboth sides of this intricate and highly-important question.\nFirst of all, it strikes the Queen that, even if M. Thiers _did_ raise\nthe cry, which was so loud, for war in France (but which the Queen\ncannot believe he _did_ to the extent Lord Palmerston does), that such\nan excitement _once_ raised in a country like France, where the people\nare more excitable than almost any other nation, it cannot be so\neasily controuled and stopped again, and the Queen thinks this will be\nseen in time.\nSecondly, the Queen cannot either quite agree in Lord Palmerston's\nobservation, that the French Government state the danger of internal\nrevolution, if not supported, merely to extract further concessions\nfor Mehemet Ali. The Queen does not pretend to say that this danger is\nnot exaggerated, but depend upon it, a _certain_ degree of danger\ndoes exist, and that the situation of the King of the French and\nthe present French Government is not an easy one. The majority,\ntoo, cannot be depended upon, as many would vote against Odillon\nBarrot, who would _not_ vote on other occasions with the\nSoult-Guizot Ministry.\nThirdly, the danger of war is also doubtless greatly exaggerated,\nas also the numbers of the French troops. But Lord Palmerston must\nrecollect how very warlike the French are, and that if once roused,\nthey will not listen to the calm reasoning of those who wish for\npeace, or think of the great risk they run of _losing_ by war, but\nonly of the glory and of revenging insult, as they call it.\nFourthly, the Queen sees the difficulty there exists at the present\nmoment of making any specific offer to France, but she must at\nthe same time repeat how _highly_ and _exceedingly_ important she\nconsiders it that some sort of conciliatory agreement should be come\nto with France, for she cannot believe that the appeals made to her\nby the King of the French are only exertions of skilful diplomacy. The\nQueen's earnest and only wish is peace, and a maintenance of friendly\nrelations with her allies, consistent with the honour and dignity\nof her country. She does not think, however, that the last would be\ncompromised by attempts to soften the irritation still existing in\nFrance, or by attempts to bring France back to her former position in\nthe Oriental Question.\nShe earnestly hopes that Lord Palmerston will consider this, will\nreflect upon the importance of not driving France to extremities, and\nof conciliatory measures, without showing fear (for our successes on\nthe coast of Syria show our power), or without yielding to threats.\nFrance has been humbled, and France is in the wrong, but, therefore,\nit is easier than if we had failed, to do something to bring matters\nright again. The Queen has thus frankly stated her own opinion, which\nshe thought it right Lord Palmerston should know, and she is sure he\nwill see it is only dictated by an earnest desire to see _all_ as much\nunited as possible on this important subject.",

    "body": "... As to politics, I do not wish to say much to-day. Palmerston,\n_rex_ and autocrat, is, for a Minister finding himself in such\nfortunate circumstances, far _too irritable and violent_. One does not\nunderstand the use of showing so much hatred and anger. What he says\nabout the _appeal to the personal feeling of the Queen, on the part\nof the King of the French_, is childlike and malicious, for it has\n_never_ existed.\nThe King was for many years the great friend of the Duke of Kent,\nafter whose death he remained a friend of Victoria. His relations with\nthe latter have, up to 1837, passed through very varied phases; she\nwas for a long time an object of hatred in the family, who had not\ntreated the Duke of Kent over-amicably, and a proof of this is the\nfact that the Regent, from the year 1819, forbade the Duke his house\nand presence--which was probably another nail in the Duke's coffin.\nMany of these things are quite unknown to Victoria, or forgotten\nby her. Still it is only fair not to forget the people who were her\nfriends before 1837; after that date there was a violent outbreak of\naffection among people who in the year 1836 would still not go near\nVictoria. October 1836, when he sat next her at dinner, was the\nfirst time that Palmerston himself had ever seen Victoria except at a\ndistance. As you have the best means of knowing, the King has not even\ndreamt of applying to Victoria.\nAs to danger, it was very great in September, on the occasion of the\n_ouvrier_ riot--for a Paris mob fires at once, a thing which--Heaven\nbe thanked!--English mobs rarely do. Towards the end of October, when\nThiers withdrew, there was a possibility of a revolution, and it was\nonly the fear of people of wealth that kept them together, and drew\nthem towards Guizot.\nA revolution, at once democratic and bellicose, could not but become\nmost dangerous. That was on the cards, and only a fairly fortunate\ncombination of circumstances saved matters. The King and my poor\nmother-in-law were terribly _low_, _on both occasions_, and I confess\nthat I looked everyday with the greatest anxiety for the news. If the\npoor King had been murdered, or even if he were now to be murdered,\nwhat danger, what confusion would follow! All these things were met by\nPalmerston with the excessively _nonchalante_ declaration, _it was not\nso, and it is not so_! Those are absolutely baseless assertions, and\ntotally valueless. At least I could estimate the danger as well as he\nand Bulwer--and, indeed, it was an anxious crisis. I should think the\nRevolution of 1790 _et ce qui s'en est suivi_ had done a brisk enough\nbusiness in Europe, and to risk a new one of the same kind would\nreally be somewhat scandalous.\nWhat, however, may be the future fruit of the seed of Palmerston's\nsowing, we do not in the least know as yet; it may, however, prove\nsufficiently full of misfortune for the future of innocent people.\nThe Eastern affairs will be put on an intelligible footing only when,\nafter these differences with Mehemet Ali, something is done for\nthe poor Porte, which is now so much out of repair. Otherwise there\nremains a little place which is called Sebastopol, and from which, as\nthe wind is almost constantly favourable, one can get very quickly\nto Constantinople--and Constantinople is always the one place which\nexercises the greatest influence, and all the more because the ducats\ncome from that quarter, with results which the marked economy of\nEngland is hardly likely to effect....\nVictoria has borne herself bravely and properly in the matter, and\n_deserves to be greatly praised_....",

I should not have bored you by\nmy presence, but the act of the christening is, in my eyes, a sort of\nclosing of the first cyclus of your dear life. I was shooting at the\nlate Lord Craven's in Berkshire, when I received the messenger who\nbrought me the horrifying news of your poor father's deadly illness. I\nhastened in bitter cold weather to Sidmouth, about two days before his\ndeath. His affairs were so much deranged that your Mother would have\nhad no means even of leaving Sidmouth if I had not taken all this\nunder my care and management. That dreary journey, undertaken, I\nthink, on the 26th of January, in bitter cold and damp weather, I\nshall not easily forget. I looked very sharp after the poor little\nbaby, then about eight months old. Arrived in London we were very\nunkindly treated by George IV., _whose great wish was to get you and\nyour Mamma out of the country_, and I must say without my assistance\nyou could _not_ have remained.... I state these facts, because it is\nuseful to remember through what _difficulties_ and _hardships_ one\nhad to struggle. You will also remember that though there existed\nthe _possibility_ of your eventually succeeding to the Crown, that\npossibility was very doubtful, the then Duchess of Clarence having\nbeen confined after your Mother, and there being every reason to think\nthat, though poor little Princess Elizabeth did not live more than\nsome months, other children might appear.\nIt was a long time from 1820 to 1837! We got over it, however, and, as\nfar as you are concerned, God be praised! safely and happily. You are\nmarried, with every prospect of many happy years to come, and your\nhappiness is _crowned_, and _consolidated_, as it were, by the birth\nof the dear little lady. Having from motives of discretion, perhaps\n_carried even too far_, not assisted at your coming to the throne,\nnor at your Coronation, nor afterwards at your marriage, I wished to\nassist at the christening of the little Princess, an event which is of\ngreat importance....",

Such a Motion, if made, there is\nvery little chance of resisting with success, and nothing is more to\nbe apprehended and deprecated than such an interference of the House\nof Commons with the interior discipline and government of the Army.\nIt was also felt that the general order issued by the Horse Guards\nwas not sufficient to meet the case, and in these circumstances it was\nthought proper that Lord Melbourne should see Lord Hill, and should\nexpress to him the opinion of the Cabinet, that it was necessary that\nhe should advise your Majesty to take such measures as should have the\neffect of removing Lord Cardigan from the command of the 11th Hussars.\nThe repeated acts of imprudence of which Lord Cardigan has been\nguilty, and the repeated censures which he has drawn down upon\nhimself, form a ground amply sufficient for such a proceeding, and\nindeed seem imperiously to demand it.\nLord Melbourne has seen Lord Hill and made to him this communication,\nand has left it for his consideration. Lord Hill is deeply chagrined\nand annoyed, but will consider the matter and confer again with Lord\nMelbourne upon it to-morrow.",

He would also like Peel to be cautioned not to press\nHer Majesty to decide hastily, but to give Her Majesty time, and that\nhe should feel that if he acted fairly he would be met in the same\nspirit by the Queen.\nWith regard to future communication with Lord Melbourne, the Queen\nsaid she did not mean that a change should exclude her from Lord\nMelbourne's society, and when Lord Melbourne said that in society Her\nMajesty could not procure Lord Melbourne's opinion upon any subject,\nand suggested that that should be obtained through the Prince, Her\nMajesty said that that could pass in writing under cover to me, but\nthat she must communicate direct.\nThe Queen, he says, leans to sending for the Duke of Wellington. Lord\nMelbourne advised that Her Majesty should make up her mind at once to\nsend for Sir Robert. He told me that it would not be without precedent\nto send for both at once; this it appears to me would obviate every\nobjection.

But this expectation has been entirely\ndisappointed; debate has unmasked the hollow pretence of humanity,\nand the meetings at Exeter Hall and in the country have completely\ncounteracted the impressions which Dr Lushington's speech had\nproduced.\nLancashire, Cheshire, and the West Riding of Yorkshire have been\nroused to strong excitement by the prospect of a reduction of the\nduty on corn. Several of the large towns have expressed their opinions\nwithout distinction of party.\nThese symptoms are said to have created some dissensions among the\nopponents of your Majesty's present Government.\nSir Robert Peel, Lord Stanley, and nearly all the eminent leaders\nof the party, profess their adherence to the principles of Mr\nHuskisson.

    "body": "MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I receive this very moment your dear letter of\nthe 18th, and without loss of time I begin my answer here, though the\nmessenger can only go to-morrow. I cannot _sufficiently_ express to\nyou my _gratitude_ for the frankness with which you have written\nto me--and let me entreat you, whenever you have anything _sur\nle c[oe]ur_, to _do the same_. I shall begin with your postscript\nconcerning the idea that I wished your present Ministers to retire,\nbecause they had become disagreeable to France. The people who\n_avancent quelque chose de la sorte_ probably have some ill-natured\nmotive which it is not always easy to guess; perhaps in the present\ninstance does it mean, let us say, _that?_ whatever opinion he may\nthen express we can easily counteract it, representing it as the\nresult of _strong partiality to France_. Let us therefore examine\nwhat France has to gain in a change of Administration. Certainly your\npresent Ministers are _not_ much loved _now_ in France, not so much in\nconsequence of the political events of last year themselves, than for\nthe _manner_ in which they came to pass. Nevertheless, when I was at\nParis, King and Council were decided to sign the treaty with the four\nother Powers, which would put an end to the _isolement_, though many\npeople are stoutly _for the isolement_. There end the relations which\nwill exist for some time between the two countries--they will be on\n_decent_ terms; that is all I wish for the present, and it is matter\nof moonshine who your Ministers are. No doubt, formerly there existed\nsuch a predilection in favour of Lord Grey's Administration and\nthose who continued it, that the coming in of the Tories would have\nbeen considered as a great public calamity; but even now, though\nthis affection is gone, the Tories will also be looked on with some\nsuspicion. Lord Melbourne's Administration has had the great merit of\nbeing liberal, and at the same time prudent, conservative in the good\nsense of the word, preserving what was good. Monarchy, by an adherence\nto this system, was very safe, and the popular liberal cry needless.\n(_Continued at_) LAEKEN, _21st May._\nI regret that the Corn question was brought forward somewhat\nabruptly; it is a dangerous one, as it roused the most numerous\nand poorest classes of society, and may easily degenerate into\nbloodshed. The dissolution under such circumstances would become still\nmore a source of agitation, as it generally always is in England. Lord\nMelbourne, I am sure, will think so too.\nI am delighted by what you say of Albert; it is just the proper line\nfor him to take, without biassing you either way, to show you honestly\nthe consequences which in his opinion the one or the other may have.\nAs he has really a very clear and logical judgment, his opinion will\nbe valuable for you. I feel very much for you, and these Ministerial\ncomplications are of a most painful and perplexing nature, though\nless in England than on the Continent, as the thing is at least better\nunderstood. To amuse you a little, and to prove to you how impartial\nI must be to be in this way accused by both parties, I must tell you\nthat it is said in France that, conjointly with Lord Melbourne,\nwe _artfully_ ruined the Thiers Administration, to the great\ndetriment of the honour and welfare of France. But what is still\nstranger is, that the younger branches of the family, seeing that my\narrival at Paris was delayed from time to time, became convinced that\n_I would not come at all_, and that my intention was to _cut them\ncompletely_, not to _compromettre_ myself with England! Truly people\nare strange, and the unnecessary suspicions and stories which they\nlove to have, and to tell, a great bore....\nPray have the goodness of giving my _kindest_ regards to Lord\nMelbourne. I will love him very _tenderly_ in and out of office, as\nI am really attached to him. Now last, though first, I offer my\nsincerest wishes on the happy return of your birthday; may every\nblessing be always bestowed on your beloved head. You possess _much_,\nlet your warm and honest heart _appreciate_ that. Let me also express\nthe hope that you always will maintain your _dear character true_\nand _good_ as it is, and let us also humbly express the hope that\nour warmth of feeling, a valuable gift, will not be permitted to\ngrow occasionally a little violent, and particularly not against your\nuncle. You may pull Albertus by the ear, when so inclined, but be\nnever irritated against your uncle. But I have _not to complain_ when\nother people do not instigate such things; you have always been kind\nand affectionate, and when you look at my deeds for you, and on\nbehalf of you, these twenty-two years, I think you will not have many\nhardships to recollect. I am happy to hear of my god-daughter's teeth,\nand that she is so well. May God keep the whole dear little family\nwell and happy for ever. My dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

I wished to know that he felt assured,\nthough I trusted there could be no doubt upon his mind, that there\nhad been perfect honesty of purpose on my part towards him, and more\nespecially upon the part of those with whose knowledge I had been\nacting. I assured Sir Robert that H.M. had acted in _the most perfect\nfairness towards him_, and I was most anxious that there should be no\nerroneous impression upon his mind as to the conduct of either H.M. or\nthe Prince.\nI said (quoting the Prince's expression), \"that the Queen has a\nnatural modesty upon her constitutional views, and when she receives\nan advice from men like the Lord Chancellor, Lord John Russell, Mr\nBaring, Mr Labouchere, and Lord Clarendon, and knows that they have\nbeen weighing the question through so many days, she concludes that\nher judgment cannot be better than theirs, and that she would do wrong\nto reject their advice.\"\nThe Prince, I said, however strongly impressed for or against a\nquestion, thinks it wrong and impolitic, considering his age and\ninexperience and his novelty to the country, to press upon the Queen\nviews of his own in opposition to those of experienced statesmen. Sir\nRobert said he could relieve my mind entirely; that he was convinced\nthat all that had taken place had been with the most perfect honesty;\nthat he had no feeling whatever of annoyance, or of having been\nill-used; that, on the contrary, he had the feeling, and should always\nretain it, of the deepest gratitude to the Queen for the condescension\nwhich Her Majesty had been pleased to show him, and that it had only\nincreased his devotion to Her Majesty's person. He said that much of\nthe reserve which he had shown in treating with me was not on _his\nown_ account, but that he felt from his own experience that events\nwere by no means certain, and he most cautiously abstained from\npermitting her Majesty in any way to commit herself, or to bind\nherself by any engagement which unforeseen circumstances might render\ninconvenient. Sir Robert said it was very natural to try and remove\nobstacles which had before created so much confusion, and he was\nconvinced that they would have been practically removed by what had\npassed. He said that neither Lord Stanley nor Sir James Graham knew\na word of what had passed. That Mr Greville had asked his friend Mr\nArbuthnot whether some understanding had not been entered into between\nLord Melbourne and him. That Mr Arbuthnot had replied that he was\ncertain that nothing of the sort could have passed, as, if it had,\nSir Robert Peel would have informed him (Mr Arbuthnot) of the fact.\nAgain, Lady de Grey, the night of the ball at the Palace, came up to\nhim and said the Duke of Bedford had been speaking to her about the\nresignation of the Duchess of Bedford, and asking her whether she\nthought it necessary. She volunteered to find out from Sir Robert\nwhether he thought it requisite. She asked the question, which Sir\nRobert tried to evade, but not being able, he said it struck him that\nif it was a question of doubt the best means of solving it, was for\nthe Duke of Bedford to ask Lord Melbourne for his opinion.\nI added that if the dissolution was a failure, which it was generally\napprehended would be the case, I felt convinced that Sir Robert would\nbe dealt with in the most perfect fairness by Her Majesty.",

    "body": "MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--Your Mother is safely arrived, though she\nwas received close to Ostende by a formidable thunderstorm. I had\ngiven directions that everywhere great civilities should be shown her.\nShe stood the fatigues better than I had expected, and is less sleepy\nthan in England. She seems to be pleased with her _s\u00e9jour_ here, and\ninclined in fact to remain rather than to go on; but I am sure, when\nonce in Germany she will be both pleased and interested by it. It will\namuse you to hear from herself her own impressions.\nI cannot help to add a few political lines. I regret much, I must\nconfess, that the idea of a dissolution has gained ground, and I will\ntry to show in a very few words why I am against it.\nIn politics, a great rule ought to be to rule with the things which\none _knows already_, and not to jump into something entirely new of\nwhich no one can do more _than guess the consequences._ The present\nParliament has been elected at a moment most favourable to the\npresent Administration after a most popular accession to the throne,\neverything new and fresh, and with the natural fondness of the great\nmass of people, a change is always popular; it was known that you were\nkindly disposed towards your Ministers, everything was therefore\n_\u00e0 souhait_ for the election of a new Parliament. In this respect\nMinisters have nothing like the favourable circumstances which smiled\nupon them at the last general election. Feeling this, they raise a\ncry, which may become popular and embarrass their antagonists about\n_cheap_ bread! I do not think this is quite befitting their\ndignity; such things do for revolutionaries like Thiers, or my\nlate Ministers.... If the thing rouses the people it may do serious\nmischief; if not, it will look awkward for the Ministers themselves.\nIf you do not grant a dissolution to your present Ministers you would\nhave, at the coming in of a new Administration, the right to tell them\nthat they must go on with the present Parliament; and I have no doubt\nthat they could do so. The statistics of the present House of Commons\nare well known to all the men who sit in it, and to keep it a few\nyears longer would be a real advantage.\nYou know that I have been rather maltreated by the Tories, formerly to\nplease George IV., and since I left the country, because I served, in\ntheir opinion, on the revolutionary side of the question. I must\nsay, however, that for your service as well as for the quiet of the\ncountry, it would be good to give them a trial. If they could not\nremain in office it will make them quieter for some time. If by\na dissolution the Conservative interest in the House is too much\nweakened the permanent interests of the country can but suffer from\nthat. If, on the contrary, the Conservatives come in stronger, your\nposition will not be very agreeable, and it may induce them to be\nperhaps less moderate than they ought to be. I should be very happy if\nyou would discuss these, my _hasty_ views, with Lord Melbourne. I\ndo not give them for more than what they are, mere _practical_\nconsiderations; but, as far as I can judge of the question, if I was\nmyself concerned I should have no dissolution; if even there was but\nthe very _banale_ consideration, _qu'on sait ce qu'on a, mais qu'on ne\nsait nullement ce qu'on aura_. The moment is not without importance,\nand well worthy your earnest consideration, and I feel convinced that\nLord Melbourne will agree with me, that, notwithstanding the great\npolitical good sense of the people in England, the machine is so\ncomplicated that it should be handled with great care and tenderness.\nTo conclude, I must add that perhaps a permanent duty on corn may be a\ndesirable thing, but that it ought to be sufficiently high to serve as\na real protection. It may besides produce this effect, that as it\nwill be necessary, at least at first, to buy a good deal of the to be\nimported corn with _money_, the currency will be seriously affected\nby it. The countries which would have a chance of selling would be\nchiefly Poland in all its parts, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, the\nSouth of Russia on the Black Sea, and maybe Sicily. Germany does not\ngrow a sufficient quantity of wheat to profit by such an arrangement;\nit will besides not buy more from England for the present than it does\nnow, owing to the Zollverein, which must first be altered. But I\nwill not bore you too long, and conclude with my best love to little\nVictoria, of whom her Grandmama speaks with raptures. Ever, my dearest\nVictoria, your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

    "body": "MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN,--I crave leave humbly to approach your\nMajesty and to state in writing what I should have submitted to your\nRoyal consideration at an Audience, because I conceive that this\ncourse will be attended with less inconvenience to your Majesty.\nIn the counsel which I ventured with great humility, but with an\nentire conviction of its soundness, to tender, I cannot be biassed by\nany personal interest, for I am not a candidate for office; nor by any\nParliamentary interest, for I have no concern with elections; nor by\nany factious interest, for I am unconnected with party. My only\nmotive is to discharge the duty which I owe to both the Crown and the\ncountry. Nor am I under the influence of any prejudice against your\nMajesty's servants or their measures; for I charge your Majesty's\nservants with nothing beyond an error, a great error, in judgment, and\nI entirely approve of the measures which they have lately propounded\n(with a single exception partially applicable to one of them), while I\nlament and disapprove of the time and manner of propounding them, both\non account of the Government and of the measures themselves.\nI feel myself, Madam, under the necessity of stating that the\ndissolution of the Parliament appears to me wholly without\njustification, either from principle or from policy. They who advise\nit must needs proceed upon the supposition that a majority will be\nreturned favourable to the continuance of the present Administration\nand favourable to their lately announced policy. On no other ground is\nit possible that any such advice should be tendered to your Majesty.\nFor no one could ever think of such a proceeding as advising the\nCrown to dissolve the Parliament in order to increase the force of the\nOpposition to its own future Ministers, thus perverting to the mere\npurposes of party the exercise of by far the most eminent of the Royal\nprerogatives; and I pass over as wholly unworthy of notice the only\nother supposition which can with any decency be made, when there is\nno conflict between the two Houses, namely, that of a dissolution\nin entire ignorance of the national opinion and for the purpose of\nascertaining to which side it inclines. Your Majesty's advisers must,\ntherefore, have believed, and they must still believe, that a majority\nwill be returned favourable both to themselves and their late policy.\nI, on the other hand, have the most entire conviction that there will\nbe a considerable majority against them, and against their policy a\nmajority larger still, many of their supporters having already joined\nto swell that majority. Whoever examines the details of the case\nmust be satisfied that the very best result which the Government can\npossibly hope for is a narrow majority against them--an event which\nmust occasion a second dissolution by whatever Ministry may succeed\nto the confidence of your Majesty. But those best acquainted with\nthe subject have no doubt at all that the majority will be much more\nconsiderable.\nI beg leave, Madam, humbly to represent to your Majesty, in my own\nvindication for not having laid my opinion before your Majesty as\nsoon as I returned from the Continent, that when I first heard of\nthe course taken by the Government early in May, I formed the opinion\nwhich I now entertain, but conceived that I must have mistaken the\nfacts upon which they were acting; and when I arrived twelve days ago\nI was confirmed in the belief (seeing the fixed resolution taken to\ndissolve) that I must have been under an erroneous impression as to\nthe probable results of the elections. But I have since found ample\nreason for believing that my original conviction was perfectly well\nfounded, and that no grounds whatever exist sufficient to make any\none who considers the subject calmly, and without the bias of either\ninterest or prejudice, really believe that this ill-fated proceeding\ncan have any other result than lasting injury to your Majesty's\nservice, to the progress of sound and just views of policy, and to\nthe influence of those in whom the Crown and the country alike should\nrepose confidence.\nThat a number of short-sighted persons whose judgments are warped by\nexclusive attention to a single subject, or by personal feelings, or\nby party views (and these narrow and erroneous), may have been loudly\nclamorous for the course apparently about to be pursued, is extremely\npossible, and affords no kind of excuse for it. Many of these will be\nthe slowest to defend what they have so unfortunately called for; some\nwill be among the first to condemn it when a manifest failure shall\nhave taken place, and general discomfiture shall throw a few local\nsuccesses into the shade.\nMy advice is humbly offered to your Majesty, as removed far above such\nconfined and factious views; as the parent of all your people; as both\nbound and willing to watch over their true interests; and as charged\nby virtue of your exalted office with the preservation of the public\npeace, the furtherance of the prosperity, and the maintenance of the\nliberties of your subjects.\nI am, with profound respect, Madam, your Majesty's faithful and\ndutiful Subject,\nBROUGHAM.",

We understand that the amendment is to be a\nrepetition of the motion of want of confidence, which Sir Robert Peel\nmade in the House of Commons before the dissolution, and nearly in the\nsame terms. It is to be moved by Lord Ripon in the House of\nLords, and by Mr. Stuart Wortley in the House of Commons. It is\nunderstood to be their intention to avoid, as much as possible, debate\nupon the Corn Laws, and upon the other topics in the Speech, and to\nplace the question entirely upon the result of the General Election\nand the proof which that affords that the Ministry does not possess\nthe confidence of the country. Lord Melbourne thinks that it will not\nbe found easy to repress debate in the House of Commons, but would not\nbe surprised if the course which it is intended to pursue should much\nshorten it in the House of Lords. Lord Melbourne will write again to\nyour Majesty after the debate, and will certainly come down to-morrow,\nunless anything unexpected should occur to prevent him.\nIt will be necessary to receive the address of the Convocation in some\nmanner or another. Lord Melbourne will write confidentially to the\nArchbishop to learn how it may be received in the quietest manner\nand with the least trouble. Lord Melbourne has little doubt that the\nLords and Commons will send their addresses by the officers of the\nHousehold.\nLord Melbourne entreats your Majesty to pick up your spirits.",

He seemed in\ntolerable spirits, though somewhat sad when he alluded to taking leave\nof the Queen. He said he was anxious that Her Majesty should lose no\ntime in writing to appoint Sir Robert Peel to be here to-morrow, for\nthough he was not afraid of Sir Robert taking affront, his Party would\nbe too ready to construe any delay on the Queen's part into a slight.\nHe said the Prince had been with him just before, and amongst other\nthings had urged him to continue to him and to the Queen his advice\nand assistance, especially on measures affecting their private\nconcerns and family concerns; he told Lord Melbourne it was on these\npoints that he felt Lord Melbourne's advice had been peculiarly sound,\nand there was no reason why this should not be continued, and any\ncommunication might be made through me. Lord Melbourne said that\nthe Prince had also entered upon the subject of the Baroness, and\nexpressed the constant state of annoyance he was kept in by her\ninterference. Lord Melbourne said to me: \"It will be far more\ndifficult to remove her after the change of Government than now,\nbecause if pressed to do it by a Tory Minister, the Queen's prejudice\nwould be immediately aroused.\" I admitted this, but said that though\nthe Prince felt that if he pressed the point against the Baroness\nremaining, he should be able to carry it, still his good feeling and\naffection for the Queen prevented him from pressing what he knew would\nbe painful, and what could not be carried without an exciting scene;\nhe must remain on his guard, and patiently abide the result. People\nwere beginning much better to understand that lady's character, and\ntime must surely work its own ends.\nOn my being sent for by the Prince, Lord Melbourne said, \"I shall\nsee you again before I take my leave.\" I was much affected by the\nearnestness with which this was said, and said I would certainly be\nwith him before he saw the Queen to-morrow.\nThe Prince said that Her Majesty was cheerful and in good spirits,\nand the only part of the approaching scene which he dreaded was\nthe farewell with Lord Melbourne.

    "body": "Directly I got here this morning the Prince sent for me, and said he\nhad been made somewhat uneasy by a conversation he had just had with\nthe Queen. Her Majesty said that after the manner in which the Tories\nhad treated the Prince (relative to annuity) he ought now to keep them\nat a distance. She said they would try to flatter him, and would all\ncome to see him; this he should resist, and should refuse to see them,\nat all events for some time.\nThe Prince wished me to mention this to Lord Melbourne when I went to\ntake leave of him, and to urge Lord Melbourne to set this right with\nthe Queen by his advice before he parted with the Queen, reminding him\nthat his view had always been that from this moment the Prince would\ntake up a new position, and that the Queen, no longer having Lord\nMelbourne to resort to in case of need, must from this moment consult\nand advise with the Prince. That Lord Melbourne should urge the Queen\nto have no scruple in employing the Prince, and showing that unless\na proper understanding existed from the first, he in attempting to do\ngood would be easily misrepresented.\nI found Lord Melbourne alone in his dressing-room and put this case\nbefore him. He said he had always thought that when he left the\nservice of the Queen the Prince would of necessity be brought forward,\nand must render great assistance to the Queen; and the Queen's\nconfidence in his judgment having so much increased, this consequence\nwas the more natural. The Prince must, however, be very cautious at\nfirst, and in a little time he would fall into it. He must be\nvery careful not to alarm the Queen, by Her Majesty for an instant\nsupposing that the Prince was carrying on business with Peel without\nher cognisance.\nIf it were possible for any one to advise Peel, he would recommend\nthat he should write fully to Her Majesty, and _elementarily_, as Her\nMajesty always liked to have full knowledge upon everything which was\ngoing on. He would advise the Queen to be cautious in giving a verbal\ndecision, that she should not allow herself to be _driven into a\ncorner_, and forced to decide where she felt her mind was not made up\nand required reflection.\nPeel should be very careful that intelligence came first from him\ndirect. King William was very particular upon this point, so was the\nQueen.\nI asked Lord Melbourne if he had considered the future position of\nhimself with the Queen, and also of Peel with the Queen. He said he\nowned he had not and would avoid entering into any discussion--he felt\nsure that he should be regarded with extreme jealousy, not so much by\nPeel as by the party. He would be looked upon as Lord Bute had been in\nhis relation to George III.,--always suspected of secret\nintercourse and intrigue. He would make me the medium of any written\ncommunication.\nWith regard to Peel's position with the Queen, he thought that\ncircumstances must make it. He thought the Queen must see him oftener\nthan King William did him, as he thought the present state of things\nwould require more frequent intercourse. The late King used to see\nhim once a week after the Lev\u00e9e, seldom oftener; all the rest of the\nbusiness was transacted by correspondence, but this mode, though it\nhad its merits in some respect, very much impeded the public business.\nThe less personal objections the Queen took to any one the better, as\nany such expression is sure to come out and a personal enemy is\nmade. It was also to be recollected that Peel was in a very different\nposition now, backed by a large majority, to when the other overture\nwas made. He had the power _now_ to extort what he pleased, and he\nfancied he saw the blank faces of the heads of the Party when Peel\ntold them that he had agreed to the dismissal or resignation of only\nthree of the Queen's ladies.\nLord Melbourne said the Queen was afraid she never could be at ease\nwith Peel, because his manner was so embarrassed, and that conveyed\nembarrassment also to her, which it would be very difficult to get\nover.\nThe Queen took leave of Lord Melbourne to-day. Her Majesty was much\naffected, but soon recovered her calmness.\nPeel had his first audience at half-past three o'clock.",

    "body": "... The first interview with Sir Robert Peel has gone off well, and\nonly lasted twenty minutes; and he sends the Queen to-morrow, in\nwriting, the proposed arrangements, and will only come down on\nWednesday morning. He first wished to come to-morrow, but on the\nQueen's saying that he need not to do that, but might send it and only\ncome down Wednesday, he thought the Queen might prefer having it to\nconsider a little, which she said she certainly should, though she\nmeant no want of confidence. The Queen, in the first instance, stated\nthat she concluded he was prepared for her sending for him, and then\nstated exactly what Lord Melbourne wrote, viz., the resignation having\ntaken place in consequence of the Addresses--the Queen's great regret\nat parting with her present Ministers--the confidence she had in them,\nand her only acceding in consequence of the Addresses in Parliament,\nand then that consequently she looked to him (Sir Robert Peel) as\npossessing the confidence of both Houses of Parliament to form an\nAdministration. He made many protestations of his sorrow, at what must\ngive pain to the Queen (as she said to him it did), but of course said\nhe accepted the task. The Duke of Wellington's health too uncertain,\nand himself too prone to sleep coming over him--as Peel expressed\nit--to admit of his taking an office in which he would have much to\ndo, but to be in the Cabinet, which the Queen expressed her wish he\nshould. He named Lord De Grey as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,\nand Lord Eliot as Secretary for Ireland, who, he said, were both\nmoderate people. The Queen said she gave up to him the officers of\nState and those of her Household who were in Parliament, and he then\nasked if Lord Liverpool would be agreeable as Lord Steward (the Queen\nsaid he would), and if she would object to Lord Jersey as Master of\nthe Horse (she said she would not), as she believed he understood it\nperfectly. He said he was so anxious to do everything which could be\nagreeable to the Queen, that he wished her to name whom she should\nlike as Lord Chamberlain; she said he might suggest some one, but as\nhe would not, and pressed the Queen to name whoever she pleased,\nshe said she should like the Duke of Rutland, and he said he would\ncertainly name it to him. The Queen said that Lord Melbourne had\nalways been very particular to name no one who might be disagreeable\nto her in the Household, and Sir R. Peel said he felt this, and\nshould be most anxious to do what could be agreeable to me and for my\ncomfort, and that he would even sacrifice any advantage to this. The\nQueen mentioned the three Ladies' resignation, and her wish not to\nfill up the three Ladies' places immediately. She mentioned Lady\nByron, to which he agreed immediately, and then said, as I had\nalluded to those communications, he hoped that he had been understood\nrespecting the _other_ appointments (meaning the Ladies), that\nprovided I chose some who had a leaning towards the politics of the\nAdministration, I might take any I liked, and that he quite understood\nthat I should notify it to them. The Queen said this was her rule, and\nthat she wished to choose moderate people who should not have scruples\nto resign in case another Administration should come in, as changing\nwas disagreeable to her. Here it ended, and so far well. He was\nvery anxious the Queen should understand _how_ anxious he was to do\neverything which was agreeable to the Queen. The Queen wishes to know\nif Lord Melbourne thinks she should name the Duchess of Buccleuch\nMistress of the Robes, on Wednesday, and if she shall ask Sir Robert\nto sound the Duchess, or some one else, and then write to appoint her?\nShe thinks of proposing Lady de la Warr and Lady Abercorn by and by as\nthe two Ladies, but these she will sound herself through other people,\nor Lady Canning, or Lady Rosslyn, in case these others should not take\nit. She should say she meant to sound those, and no more. What the\nQueen felt when she parted from her dear, kind friend, Lord Melbourne,\nis better imagined than described; she was dreadfully affected for\nsome time after, but is calm now. It is very, very sad; and she cannot\nquite believe it yet. The Prince felt it very, very much too, and\nreally the Queen cannot say how kind and affectionate he is to her,\nand how anxious to do everything to lighten this heavy trial; he was\nquite affected at this sad parting. We do, and shall, miss you so\ndreadfully; Lord Melbourne will easily understand what a change it\nis, after these four years when she had the happiness of having Lord\nMelbourne always about her. But it will not be so long till we meet\nagain. Happier and brighter times will come again. We anxiously hope\nLord Melbourne is well, and got up well and safe. The Queen trusts he\nwill take care of his valuable health, now more than ever.",

He had\nreceived the account of Her Majesty's first interview with Peel, which\nhe thought very satisfactory. Sir Robert very much regretted that he\nshould have been the instrument of obliging Her Majesty to change her\nGovernment. The Queen had said to Sir Robert that though she did not\nconceive the Minister could demand any of the Household appointments,\nstill it was Her Majesty's intention to give up to him the great\noffices of State, and all other places in the Household filled by\npeople in Parliament. He was to send his proposed list for offices the\nnext day and be at Windsor the morning after that. Lord Melbourne\nhad written to the Queen the night before, stating his opinion of the\nPrince--that he had great discretion, temper, and judgment, and that\nhe considered him to be well worthy of Her Majesty's confidence, and\nthat now was the time for Her Majesty to feel comfort and assistance\nfrom giving him her fullest confidence. He had just received the\nQueen's answer to this, saying what \"pleasure it had given the Queen\nto receive his letter with this expression of his opinion of her\nbeloved husband, and that what he said could not fail to increase\nthe confidence which she already felt in him. He was indeed a great\ncomfort to her in this trying moment; at times she was very low indeed\nthough she strove to bear up. It would always be a satisfaction to\nher to feel secure of Lord Melbourne's faithful and affectionate\nfriendship to her and the Prince. She hoped after a time to see him\nhere again, and it would always be a pleasure to her to hear from him\nfrequently.\"\nFrom South Steet I went to Sir Robert Peel's. I told him I came to\nspeak to him about Lord Exeter, whom the Prince proposed to make\nthe head of his Household, should it not interfere with any of Sir\nRobert's arrangements for the Queen. Sir Robert said he was so good a\nman and one that he felt sure the Prince would like, and he therefore\nthought he had better propose the situation to him at once.",

Your Majesty should desire Sir Robert\nPeel to give notice to all those who have insignia of office, such\nas Seals, Wands, to give up, to attend at Claremont on Friday; but of\ncourse he will do this of himself. Your Majesty will have much to go\nthrough upon that day and much that is painful. Your Majesty should\nspare yourself and be spared as much as possible.

The Arbuthnots are quiet, demure people\nbefore others; but they are not without depth of purpose, and they are\nvery bitter at bottom.\nYour Majesty will not forget the two Knights for Mr de la Beche\nand Major Monro.\nLord Melbourne begins to hope that this affair will be got through\nmore satisfactorily and with less annoyance than your Majesty\nanticipated. As long as your Majesty is desirous of receiving his\ncommunications, he will be always most careful to give your Majesty\nhis impartial opinion and the best advice which he has to offer.

Your kind letter gave me great pleasure, and\nI must own your silence on all that was going on distressed me very\nmuch! It has been indeed a sad time for me, and I am still bewildered,\nand can't believe that my excellent Lord Melbourne is no longer\nmy Minister, but he will be, as you say, and has _already_ proved\nhimself, _very_ useful and _valuable_ as my friend out of office.\nHe writes to me often, and I write to him, and he gives really the\nfairest and most impartial advice possible. But after seeing him for\nfour years, with very few exceptions--_daily_--you may imagine that I\n_must_ feel the change; and the longer the time gets since we parted,\nthe _more_ I feel it. _Eleven days_ was the _longest_ I ever was\nwithout seeing him, and this time will be elapsed on Saturday, so you\nmay imagine what the change must be. I cannot say what a comfort and\nsupport my beloved Angel is to me, and how well and how kindly\nand properly he behaves. I cannot resist copying for you what Lord\nMelbourne wrote to me about Albert, the evening after we parted; he\nhas already praised him greatly to me, before he took leave of me. It\nis as follows:\n\"Lord Melbourne cannot satisfy himself without again stating to your\nMajesty in writing what he had the honour of saying to your Majesty\nrespecting H.R.H. the Prince. Lord Melbourne has formed the highest\nopinion of H.R.H.'s judgment, temper, and discretion, and he cannot\nbut feel a great consolation and security in the reflection that\nhe leaves your Majesty in a situation in which your Majesty has the\ninestimable advantage of such advice and assistance. Lord Melbourne\nfeels certain that your Majesty cannot do better than have recourse to\nit, whenever it is needed, and rely upon it with confidence.\"\nThis naturally gave me great pleasure, and made me very proud, as it\ncomes from a person who is no flatterer, and would not have said it if\nhe did not think so, or feel so. The new Cabinet you have by this time\nseen in the papers.\nThe Household (of which I send you a list) is well constituted--_for\nTories_.\nLord Aberdeen has written to me to say Bourqueney has announced Ste\nAulaire as Ambassador. This is very well, but let me beg you, for\ndecency's sake, to stop his coming immediately; if _even not meant_\nto, it would have the effect of their sending an ambassador the moment\nthe Government changed, which would be too marked, and most _offensive\npersonally_ to _me_. Indeed Guizot behaved very badly about refusing\nto sign the Slave Trade Treaty which they had so long ago settled\nto do; it is unwise and foolish to irritate the late Government who\nmay so easily come in again; for Palmerston will _not_ forgive nor\n_forget_ offences, and then France would be worse off than before,\nwith England. I therefore _beg_ you to stop Ste Aulaire for a little\nwhile, else _I_ shall feel it a great personal offence.\n_9th._--I have had a letter from Lord Melbourne to-day, who is much\ngratified by yours to him.... Now adieu! Believe me, always, your\ndevoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

However, I wish she would correct the gross errors which\notherwise will go down to posterity.

He is the last man who\nwould wish that a Minister who has the whole machine of the Government\nbefore him should be necessarily thwarted or interfered with in the\nselection of those whom he may be desirous to employ. Lord Melbourne\nwould therefore by no means advise your Majesty to throw difficulty in\nthe way of the diplomatic arrangements which may be proposed, unless\nthere should be in them anything manifestly and glaringly bad. The\nnomination of Lord ---- would have been so, but otherwise it cannot\nvery greatly signify who is the Ambassador at Vienna, or even at\nPetersburg or Paris. Stuart de Rothesay and Strangford are not\ngood men, either of them, but it will be difficult for Lord Aberdeen\nto neglect their claims altogether. Heytesbury is an able man, the\nbest they have. Sir Robert Gordon is an honest man, slow but not\nilliberal. It would be well if your Majesty showed Lord Aberdeen that\nyou know these men, and have an opinion upon the subject of them.\nCanada is another matter. It is a most difficult and most hazardous\ntask. There has been recent rebellion in the country. A new\nConstitution has lately been imposed upon it by Parliament.

Upon a change of Government a very great and sudden change\nof all or many of the Ministers at Foreign Courts is an evil and to be\navoided, inasmuch as it induces an idea of a general change of policy,\nand disturbs everything that has been settled. George III. always set\nhis face against and discouraged such numerous removals as tending to\nshake confidence abroad in the Government of England generally and to\ngive it a character of uncertainty and instability.

The\nmail for India, which should have been despatched on the 1st, had been\ndetained till Monday the 6th by the direction of your Majesty's late\nMinisters, in order to enable your Majesty's present servants to\ntransmit to India and China any orders which it might seem to them\nto be expedient to issue forthwith. Further delay would have been\nproductive of much mercantile inconvenience, and in India probably of\nmuch alarm. In this emergency your Majesty's Ministers thought\nthat your Majesty would be graciously pleased to approve of their\nexercising at once the power of directing the immediate transmission\nto India of these Instructions.\nYour Majesty must have had frequently before you strong proofs of\nthe deep interest taken by Russia in the affairs of Herat, and your\nMajesty cannot but be sensible of the difficulty of maintaining in\nEurope that good understanding with Russia which has such an important\nbearing upon the general peace, if serious differences should exist\nbetween your Majesty and that Power with respect to the States of\nCentral Asia.\nBut even if the annexation of Herat to the kingdom of Cabul were\nnot to have the effect of endangering the continuance of the good\nunderstanding between your Majesty and Russia, still your Majesty will\nnot have failed to observe that the further advance of your Majesty's\nforces 360 miles into the interior of Central Asia for the purpose\nof effecting that annexation, could not but render more difficult\nof accomplishment the original intention of your Majesty, publicly\nannounced to the world, of withdrawing your Majesty's troops from\nAfghanistan as soon as Shah Sooja should be firmly established upon\nthe throne he owes to your Majesty's aid.\nThese considerations alone would have led Lord Ellenborough to desire\nthat the execution of the orders given on the 4th of June should at\nleast be delayed until your Majesty's confidential servants had had\ntime to consider maturely the Policy which it might be their duty to\nadvise your Majesty to sanction with respect to the countries on the\nright bank of the Indus; but financial considerations strengthened\nthis desire, and seemed to render it an imperative duty to endeavour\nto obtain time for mature reflection before any step should be taken\nwhich might seriously affect the tranquillity of Europe, and must\nnecessarily have disastrous effects upon the Administration of India.\nIt appeared that the political and military charges now incurred\nbeyond the Indus amounted to \u00a31,250,000 a year--that the estimate of\nthe expense of the additions made to the Army in India, since April\n1838, was \u00a31,138,750 a year, and that the deficit of Indian Revenue\nin 1839-40 having been \u00a32,425,625, a further deficit of \u00a31,987,000 was\nexpected in 1840-41.\nYour Majesty must be too well informed of the many evils consequent\nupon financial embarrassment, and entertains too deep a natural\naffection for all your Majesty's subjects, not to desire that in\nwhatever advice your Majesty's confidential servants may tender to\nyour Majesty with respect to the Policy to be observed in Afghanistan,\nthey should have especial regard to the effect which the protracted\ncontinuance of military operations in that country, still more any\nextension of them to a new and distant field, would have upon the\nFinances of India, and thereby upon the welfare of eighty millions of\npeople who there acknowledge your Majesty's rule.",

I might tell this\nto Lord Melbourne, and say that if he was totally disconnected from\nhis Party, instead of being the acknowledged head, there would not\nbe the same objection. He said, Remind Lord Melbourne of the time\nimmediately after the Queen's accession, when he had promised the King\nof the Belgians to write to him from time to time an account of all\nthat was going on in this country; and upon Lord Melbourne telling\nhim of this promise, he replied, This will not do. It cannot be kept a\nsecret that you keep up this correspondence, and jealousy and distrust\nwill be the fruit of a knowledge of it. \"Leave it to me,\" he said, \"to\narrange with the King; you cease to write, and I will put it straight\nwith the King.\"\nThe Baron seemed to expect Lord Melbourne to draw the inference from\nthis that a correspondence between Lord Melbourne and the Queen was\nfraught with the same danger, and would, when known, be followed\nby distrust and jealousy on the part of Sir Robert Peel. I said I\nreconciled it to myself because I felt that it had been productive of\nmuch good and no harm--and that, feeling that it was conducted on\nsuch honourable terms, I should not, if it were necessary, scruple to\nacquaint Sir Robert Peel of its existence. The Baron said, \"Ask Lord\nMelbourne whether he would object to it.\" He said Peel, when he heard\nit, would not, on the first impression, at all approve of it; but\nprudence and caution would be immediately summoned to his aid, and he\nwould see that it was his policy to play the generous part--and would\nsay he felt all was honourably intended, and he had no objection to\noffer--\"but,\" said the Baron, \"look to the result. Distrust, being\nimplanted from the first, whenever the first misunderstanding arose,\nor things took a wrong turn, all would, in Peel's mind, be immediately\nattributed to this cause.\"",

Whether it is to be painting or sculpture, or both; if\npainting, what sort of painting, what are to be the subjects chosen,\nand who are to be the artists employed? All these questions furnish\nample food for discussion, difference, and dispute. Chantrey says\nfresco will never do; it stands ill in every climate, will never stand\nlong in this, even in the interior of a building, and in a public work\nsuch as this is, durability is the first object to be aimed at. He\nsays that there is in the Vatican a compartment of which the middle\nportion has been painted by Giulio Romano in fresco, and at each\nof the ends there is a figure painted by Raphael in oil. The fresco\npainting has been so often repaired in consequence of decay, that not\na vestige of the original work remains; while the two figures painted\nby Raphael in oil still stand out in all their original freshness, and\neven improved from what they were when first executed....\nLord Melbourne dined and slept on Wednesday at Wimbledon. He\nmet there Lord and Lady Cottenham, Lord and Lady Langdale, Lord\nGlenelg and his brother, Mr Wm. Grant, who was his private secretary,\nand is an amusing man. Lord Melbourne is going there again to-morrow\nto stay until Monday. The place is beautiful; it is not like\nClaremont, but it is quite of the same character, and always puts Lord\nMelbourne in mind of it. The Duchess has many merits, but amongst them\nis the not small one of having one of the best cooks in England.",

That this attack had identified him as\nthe leader of his Party, at a moment when I had been most anxious\nthat he should abstain from taking an active part, and by withdrawing\nhimself from politics he would enable himself to become the more\nuseful friend to Her Majesty.

    "body": "The Queen had asked Lord Melbourne whether he would soon visit her at\nWindsor. He had not replied on that point, but had written to Prince\nAlbert in order to learn first the Prince's opinion on the feasibility\nof the matter.\nThe Prince sent for me and consulted with me. I was of opinion that\nthe Prince had better refrain from giving an answer, and that I should\ngive my opinion in the written form of a Memorandum, with which Anson\nshould betake himself to town. He was to read it aloud to Melbourne,\nand orally to add what amplifications might be necessary.\nAnd so it was done.\nMy Memorandum was as follows:--\nSir Robert Peel has yet to make his position opposite the\n    Queen, which for him to obtain is important and desirable for\n    obvious reasons. I have good cause to doubt that Sir Robert\n    is sure within himself of the good-will and confidence of the\n    Queen. As long as the secret communication exists between Her\n    Majesty and Lord Melbourne, this ground, upon which alone Sir\n    Robert could obtain the position necessary to him as Premier,\n    must remain cut away from under his feet. I hold, therefore,\n    this secret interchange an _essential injustice_ to Sir\n    Robert's present situation. I think it equally wrong to call\n    upon the Prince to give an opinion on the subject, as he has\n    not the means to cause his opinion to be either regarded or\n    complied with. In this particular matter nobody has paramount\n    power to do right or wrong but the Queen, and more especially\n    Lord Melbourne himself. To any danger which may come out of\n    this to Her Majesty's character, the caution and objection\n    must come from him, and from him alone; and if I was standing\n    in his shoes I would show the Queen, of my own accord,\n    and upon constitutional grounds _too_, that a continued\n    correspondence of that sort must be fraught with imminent\n    danger to the Queen, especially to Lord Melbourne, and to the\n    State.\nI then gave Anson the further arguments with which he was to accompany\nthe reading out of this Memo.\nOn the next day Anson went to Melbourne and told him that his note to\nhim had raised a great consultation, that the Prince felt much averse\nto giving any opinion in a case upon which he could exercise no\ncontrol, and in which, if it was known that he had given his sanction,\nhe would be held responsible for any mischief which might arise. He\nhad consulted Baron Stockmar, who had written the enclosed opinion,\nwhich the Prince had desired Anson to read to Lord Melbourne.\nMelbourne read it attentively twice through, with an occasional change\nof countenance and compression of lips. He said on concluding\nit: \"This is a most decided opinion indeed, quite an '_apple\nopinion_.'\" Anson told him that the Prince felt that if the Queen's\nconfidence in Peel was in a way to be established, it would be\nextremely shaken by his (Lord Melbourne's) visit at such a moment. He\nfelt that it would be better that Lord Melbourne's appearance should\nbe in London, where he would meet the Queen only on the terms of\ngeneral society, but at the same time he (the Prince) was extremely\nreluctant to give an opinion upon a case which Lord Melbourne's own\nsense of right ought to decide. Anson added how he feared his speech\nof yesterday in the House of Lords had added another impediment\nto his coming at this moment, as it had identified him with and\nestablished as the head of the Opposition party, which he (Anson) had\nhoped Melbourne would have been able to avoid. Melbourne, who was then\nsitting on the sofa, rushed up upon this, and went up and down the\nroom in a violent frenzy, exclaiming--\"God eternally d--n it!\"\netc., etc. \"Flesh and blood cannot stand this. I only spoke upon\nthe defensive, which Ripon's speech at the beginning of the session\nrendered quite necessary. I cannot be expected to give up my position\nin the country, neither do I think that it is to the Queen's interest\nthat I should.\"\nAnson continued that the Baron thought that no Ministry could stand\nthe force of such an undercurrent influence, that all the good that\nwas to be derived from pacifying the Queen's mind at the change had\nbeen gained, and that the danger which we were liable to, and which\nthreatened him in particular, could only be averted by his own\nstraightforward decision with the Queen. Anson asked him if _he_ saw\nany danger likely to arise from this correspondence. After a long\npause he said, \"_I certainly cannot think it right_,\" though he\nfelt sure that some medium of communication of this sort was no new\nprecedent. He took care never to say anything which could bring his\nopinion in opposition _to Sir Robert's, and he should distinctly\nadvise the Queen to adhere to her Ministers in everything,\nunless he saw the time had arrived at which it might be\nresisted_. The principal evil, replied Anson, to be dreaded from\nthe continuance of Lord Melbourne's influence was, according to the\nBaron's opinion, that so long as the Queen felt she could resort to\nLord Melbourne for his advice, she never would be disposed (from not\nfeeling the necessity) to place any real confidence in the advice she\nreceived from Peel.",

There can be no\ndoubt that your Majesty is right about the Audiences which have been\nrequested....\nSir Robert Peel is probably right in supposing that the claim of a\nPeer to an Audience of the Sovereign originated in early times, and\nbefore the present course of government by responsible advisers was\nfully and decidedly established, which it hardly can be said to have\nbeen until after the accession of the House of Hanover, but the custom\nof asking for such Audiences, and of their being in general granted,\nwas well known, and has for the most part been observed and adhered\nto. Lord Melbourne remembers that during the part of the French War,\nwhen considerable alarm began to prevail respecting its duration, and\nthe serious aspect which it was assuming, George III. gave Audiences\nto the Duke of Norfolk and others which he certainly would not have\nbeen inclined to do if he had not thought himself bound by his duty\nand by Constitutional precedent. At the time of the passing of the\nRoman Catholic Relief Act, George IV. received very many Peers, much\nno doubt against his will, who came to remonstrate with him upon the\ncourse which his Ministers were pursuing. William IV. did the same at\nthe time of the Reform Bill, and certainly spoke upon the subject in\na manner which Lord Melbourne always thought indiscreet and imprudent.\nUpon the whole, the practice has been so much acted upon and\nestablished, that Lord Melbourne will certainly not think it wise to\nmake any alteration now, especially as it has in itself beneficial\neffects, especially as in a time of strong political feeling it is a\nsatisfaction to the people to think that their wishes and opinions are\nlaid before the Sovereign fairly and impartially. It is not likely to\nbe a very heavy burthen, inasmuch as such Audiences are only asked at\nparticular moments, and they are not in themselves very burthensome\nnor difficult to deal with. It is only for the Sovereign to say that\nhe is convinced of the good motives which have actuated the step, and\nthat consideration will be given to the matter and arguments which\nhave been stated.\nLord Melbourne has one vague recollection of a correspondence upon\nthis subject between Lord Holland and some King, but does not remember\nthe circumstances with any accuracy.\nDuncannon persuaded Brougham to give up asking an Audience upon\ncondition of Lord Melbourne's promising to place his letters in your\nMajesty's hands, which he did. Lord Charlemont also was\nprevented in some manner or another, which Lord Melbourne forgets.\nUpon the whole, Lord Melbourne thinks that it is best to concede this\nprivilege of the Peerage, whether it actually exists or not, but to\nrestrain it within due and reasonable bounds, which in ordinary times\nit is not difficult to do. Extraordinary times must be dealt with as\nthey can be....\nLady A---- is, as your Majesty says, good-natured. She talks three or\nfour times as much as she ought, and like many such women often says\nexactly the things she ought not to say. Lady B---- has ten times the\nsense of her mother, and a little residue of her folly.",

The reasons which your Majesty gives are sound and just,\nand it is of great importance that a man not only of great ability but\nof high station, and perfectly in the confidence of the Government at\nhome, should be named to this important post. Lord Ellenborough is a\nman of great abilities, of much knowledge of India, of great industry\nand of very accurate habits of business, and Lord Melbourne knows of\nno objection to his appointment, except the loss of him here, where,\nwhether in or out of office, he has always been of great service.\nHe has hitherto been an unpopular man and his manners have been\nconsidered contemptuous and overbearing, but he is evidently much\nsoftened and amended in this respect, as most men are by time,\nexperience, and observation. Lord Fitzgerald is a very able\npublic man, Lord Melbourne would say one of the most able, if not the\nmost able they have; but Lord Melbourne is told by others, who know\nLord Fitzgerald better, that Lord Melbourne overrates him.

It is, however, upon the whole an\nadequate appointment, and he is perhaps more likely to go on smoothly\nwith the Court of Directors, which is a great matter, than Lord\nEllenborough.",

In France there is a great outcry that a Bourbon must be the\nfuture husband of the Queen of Spain, etc. I must say that as the\nSpaniards and the late King changed themselves the Salic custom which\nPhilip V. had brought from France, it is natural for the rest of\nEurope to wish that no Bourbon should go there. Besides, it must be\nconfessed that the thing is not even easy, as there is great hatred\namongst the various branches of that family. The King of the French\nhimself has always been _opposed_ to the idea of one of his sons going\nthere; in France, however, that opinion still exists, and Thiers had\nit, strongly.\nI confess that I regret that Queen Christina was encouraged to\nsettle at Paris, as it gave the thing the appearance of something\npreconcerted. I believe that a wish existed that Christina would\nretire peaceably and _par la force des circonstances_, but now this\ntook a turn which I am sure the King does not like; it places him,\nbesides, into _une position ingrate_; the Radicals hate him, the\nModerates will cry out that he has left them in the lurch, and the\nCarlists are kept under key, and of course also not much pleased. I\nmeant to have remained in my wilds till yesterday, but my Ministers\nwere so anxious for my return, there being a good many things on the\n_tapis_, that I came back on Tuesday, the 19th....\nHere one is exactly shut up as if one was in a menagerie, walking\nround and round like a tame bear.

I am told that if\nthe old King had not made that love-match, he would be perfectly\nable to dethrone his son; I heard that yesterday from a person rather\nattached to the son and hating the father. In the meantime, though\none can hardly say that he is well at home, some strange mixture of\ncut-throats and ruined soldiers of fortune had a mind to play us some\ntricks here; we have got more and more insight into this. Is it by\ninstigation from him personally, or does he only know of it without\nbeing a party to it?

I told [Lord Melbourne] that, as I read the English Constitution,\nit meant to assign to _the Sovereign in his functions a deliberative\npart_--that I was not sure the Queen had the means within herself to\nexecute this deliberative part properly, but I was sure that the only\nway for her to execute her functions at all was to be strictly honest\nto those men who at the time being were her Ministers. That it was\nchiefly on this account that I had been so very sorry to have found\nnow, on my return from the Continent, that on the change of the\nMinistry a capital opportunity to read a great Constitutional maxim\nto the Queen had not only been lost by Lord Melbourne, but that he had\nhimself turned an instrument for working great good into an instrument\nwhich must produce mischief and danger. That I was afraid that, from\nwhat Lord Melbourne had been so weak as to have allowed himself to be\ndriven into, _against his own and better conviction_, the Queen must\nhave received a most pernicious bias, which on any future occasion\nwould make her inclined to act in a similar position similarly to that\nwhat she does now, being convinced that what she does _now_ must be\nright on all future occasions, or else Lord Melbourne would not have\nsanctioned it. Upon this, Lord Melbourne endeavoured to palliate, to\nrepresent the danger, which would arise from his secret correspondence\nwith the Queen as very little, to adduce precedents from history,\nand to screen his present conduct behind what he imagined Lord Bute's\nconduct had been under George III. I listened patiently, and\nreplied in the end: All this might be mighty fine and quite calculated\nto lay a flattering unction on his own soul, or it might suffice to\ntranquillize the minds of the Prince and Anson, but that I was too old\nto find the slightest argument in what I had just now heard, nor could\nit in any way allay my apprehension. I began then to dissect all\nthat he had produced for his excusation, and showed him--as I thought\nclearly, and as he admitted convincingly--that it would be impossible\nto carry on this secret commerce with the Sovereign for any length\nof time without exposing the Queen's character and creating mighty\nembarrassments in the quiet and regular working of a Constitutional\nmachine.\nMy representations seemed to make a very deep impression, and Lord\nMelbourne became visibly nervous, perplexed, and distressed. After\nhe had recovered a little I said, \"I never was inclined to obtrude\nadvice; but if you don't dislike to hear my opinion, I am prepared to\ngive it to you.\" He said, \"What is it?\" I said, \"You allow the Queen's\nconfinement to pass over quietly, and you wait till her perfect\nrecovery of it. As soon as this period has arrived, you state of\nyour own accord to Her Majesty that this secret and confidential\ncorrespondence with her must cease; that you gave in to it, much\nagainst your feelings, and with a decided notion of its impropriety\nand danger, and merely out of a sincere solicitude to calm Her\nMajesty's mind in a critical time, and to prevent the ill effects\nwhich great and mental agitation might have produced on her health.\nThat this part of your purpose now being most happily achieved, you\nthought yourself in duty bound to advise Her Majesty to _cease all\nher communications_ to you on political subjects, as you felt it wrong\nwithin yourself to receive them, and to return your political advice\nand opinions on such matters; that painful as such a step must be to\nyour feelings, which to the last moment of your life will remain those\nof the most loyal attachment and devotion to the Queen's person, it\nis dictated to you by a deep sense of what you owe to the country, to\nyour Sovereign, and to yourself.\"",

There was originally but one officer,\nand at the present the three are but the heads of the different\ndepartments of one office. The first division was into two, and they\nwere called the Secretary for the Northern and the Secretary for\nthe Southern department.

Lady Palmerston is struck, as\neverybody is who goes to Ireland, with the candid warmth and vehement\ndemonstration of feeling. England always appears cold, heartless, and\nsulky in comparison....\nWith respect to the questions put to me by your Majesty at the desire\nof His Royal Highness, Lord Melbourne begs leave to assure your\nMajesty that he will be at all times most ready and anxious to give\nany information in his power upon points of this sort, which are very\ncurious, very important, very worthy to be enquired into, and\nupon which accurate information is not easily to be found. All the\npolitical part of the English Constitution is fully understood,\nand distinctly stated in Blackstone and many other books, but the\nMinisterial part, the work of conducting the executive government, has\nrested so much on practice, on usage, on understanding, that there is\nno publication to which reference can be made for the explanation\nand description of it. It is to be sought in debates, in protests, in\nletters, in memoirs, and wherever it can be picked up. It seems to\nbe stupid not to be able to say at once when two Secretaries of State\nwere established; but Lord Melbourne is not able. He apprehends that\nthere was but one until the end of Queen Anne's reign, and that two\nwere instituted by George I., probably because upon his frequent\njourneys to Hanover he wanted the Secretary of State with him, and at\nthe same time it was necessary that there should be an officer of the\nsame authority left at home to transact the domestic affairs.\n_Prime Minister_ is a term belonging to the last century. Lord\nMelbourne doubts its being to be found in English Parliamentary\nlanguage previously. Sir Robert Walpole was always accused of having\nintroduced and arrogated to himself an office previously unknown to\nthe Law and Constitution, that of Prime or Sole Minister, and we learn\nfrom Lady Charlotte Lindsay's accounts of her father, that in his\nown family Lord North would never suffer himself to be called _prime_\nMinister, because it was an office unknown to the Constitution. This\nwas a notion derived from the combined Whig and Tory opposition to Sir\nRobert Walpole, to which Lord North and his family had belonged.\nLord Melbourne is very sorry to hear that the Princess Royal continues\nto suffer from some degree of indisposition. From what your Majesty\nhad said more than once before, Lord Melbourne had felt anxiety upon\nthis subject, and he saw the Baron yesterday, who conversed with him\nmuch upon it, and informed him of what had taken place. Lord Melbourne\nhopes that your Majesty will attribute it only to Lord Melbourne's\nanxious desire for the security and increase of your Majesty's\nhappiness, if he ventures to say that the Baron appears to him to have\nmuch reason in what he urges, and in the view which he takes.

    "body": "... Your Majesty asks whether Lord Melbourne thinks that Prince\nMetternich holds the opinion of Sir Robert Gordon, which he expresses\nto Lord Beauvale. It is difficult to say what Prince Metternich's\nreal sentiments are. Lord Melbourne takes him not to have a very high\nopinion of the abilities of others in general, and he is not unlikely\nto depreciate Sir Robert Gordon to Lord Beauvale. Sir Robert Gordon is\na man of integrity, but he is tiresome, long and pompous, which cannot\nbe agreeable to the Prince, who has about him much of the French\nvivacity, and also much of their settled and regular style of\nargument....\nWith respect to the latter part of your Majesty's letter, Lord\nMelbourne returns for the expressions of your Majesty's kindness his\nwarm and grateful thanks. Your Majesty may rest assured that he will\nalways speak to your Majesty without scruple or reserve, and that he\nwill never ask anything of your Majesty, or ever make a suggestion,\nwhich he does not consider to be for your Majesty's service and\nadvantage. Lord Melbourne is of opinion that his visits to the Palace\nshould not only avoid exciting suspicion and uneasiness in your\nMajesty's present advisers, a result of which he has very little\napprehension, but they should not be so frequent as to attract public\nnotice, comment, and observation, of which he would be more fearful.\nA public rumour, however unfounded and absurd, has more force in this\ncountry than objections which have in them more of truth and reality.\nUpon these grounds, and as your Majesty will probably not see much\ncompany at present, and the parties therefore will be a good deal\nconfined to the actual Household, Lord Melbourne thinks it would\nperhaps be as well if he were not again to dine at the Palace at\npresent.\nThe course which it may be prudent to take hereafter will depend very\nmuch upon that which cannot now be foreseen, namely, upon the general\ncourse which will be taken by politics and political parties. In this\nLord Melbourne does not at present discern his way, and he will\nnot therefore hazard opinions which would not be founded upon any\ncertainty, and might be liable to immediate change and alteration.",

    "body": "The apprehension which haunts me since my return to England is well\nknown to you. It was my intention to have written to you upon it some\ntime hereafter, but the contents of a certain letter, sent by you just\nbefore your departure, accelerates the execution of my design. From\nyour own expressions used some time back, I was led to expect that you\nwould be glad to take advantage _of any fair opportunity_ which might\ncontribute towards that devoutly to be wished for object, viz., to let\na certain correspondence die a natural death. You may easily conceive\nhow much I felt disappointed when I heard that you had written\nagain, without a challenge, and that, without apparent cause, you had\nvolunteered the promise to write from time to time. This happens at\na moment when _your_ harassing apprehension received new life and\nstrength from two incidents which I think it my duty to make known to\nyou, and of which the one came to pass _before_, the other after, your\ndeparture from here. Some weeks back I was walking in the streets with\nDr Pr\u00e6torius, when, finding myself opposite the house of one\nof my friends, it came across my mind to give him a call. Pr\u00e6torius\nwanted to leave me, on a conception that, as a stranger, he might\nobstruct the freedom of our conversation. I insisted, however, on his\nremaining with me, and we were shown into the drawing-room, where\nin all there were five of us. For some minutes the conversation had\nturned on insignificant things, when the person talking to me said\nquite abruptly: \"So I find the Queen is in daily correspondence with\nLord Melbourne.\" I replied, \"Who told you this?\" The answer was, \"Mrs\nNorton; she told me the other evening. Don't you believe that Lord\nMelbourne has lost his influence over the Queen's mind; he daily\nwrites to her, and receives as many answers, in which she communicates\neverything to him.\" Without betraying much emotion I said, \"I don't\nbelieve a word of it; the Queen may have written once or twice on\nprivate matters, but the daily correspondence on all matters is\ncertainly the amplification of a thoughtless and imprudent person, who\nis not aware of such exaggerated assertions.\" My speech was followed\nby a general silence, after which we talked of other things, and\nsoon took our leave. When we were fairly in the open air, Pr\u00e6torius\nexpressed to me his amazement at what he had heard, and he remained\nfor some time at a loss to comprehend the character of the person who,\nfrom mere giddiness, let out so momentous a secret.\nThe other fact took place the day after you had left. From the late\nevents at Brussels, it had become desirable that I should see Sir\nRobert Peel. From Belgium we travelled over to Home politics. I\nexpressed my delight at seeing the Queen so happy, and added a hope\nthat more and more she would seek and find her real happiness in her\ndomestic relations only. He evidently caught at this, and assured me\nthat he should at all times be too happy to have a share in anything\nwhich might be thought conducive to the welfare of Her Majesty. That\nno consideration of personal inconvenience would ever prevent him from\nindulging the Queen in all her wishes relating to matters of a private\nnature, and that the only return for his sincere endeavours to please\nHer Majesty he looked to, was honesty in public affairs. Becoming then\nsuddenly emphatic, he continued, \"But on this I must insist, and I\ndo assure you, that that moment I was to learn that the Queen takes\nadvice upon public matters in another place, I shall throw up; for\nsuch a thing I conceive the country could not stand, and I would not\nremain an hour, whatever the consequences of my resignation may be.\"\nFully sensible that he was talking at me, I received the charge with\nthe calmness of a good conscience, and our time being exhausted I\nprepared for retreat. But he did not allow me to do so, before he had\nfound means to come a second time to the topic uppermost in his own\nmind, and he repeated, it appeared to me with increased force of tone,\nhis determination to throw up, fearless of all consequences, that\nmoment he found himself and the country dishonestly dealt by.\nI think I have now reported to you correctly the two occurrences which\nof late have added so much to my antecedent suspicions and fears.\nPermit me to join to this a few general considerations which, from\nthe nature of the recited incidents alone, and without the slightest\nintervention of any other cause, must have presented themselves to my\nmind. The first is, that I derive from the events related quite ground\nenough for concluding that the danger I dread is great and imminent,\nand that, if ill luck is to have its will, no human power can prevent\nan explosion for a day, or even for an hour. The second is the\ncontemplation--what state will the Queen be placed in by such a\ncatastrophe? That in my position, portraying to myself all the\nconsequences of such a possibility, I look chiefly to the Queen, needs\nhardly, I trust, an excuse.... Can you hope that the Queen's character\nwill ever recover from a shock received by a collision with Peel, upon\nsuch a cause? Pray illustrate to yourself this particular question by\ntaking a purely political and general survey of the time and period\nwe live in at this moment. In doing so must you not admit that all\nEngland is agreed that the Tories must have another trial, and that\nthere is a decided desire in the nation that it should be a fair\none? Would you have it said that Sir Robert Peel failed in his\ntrial, merely because the Queen alone was not fair to him, and that\nprincipally you had aided her in the game of dishonesty? And can you\nhope that this game can be played with security, even for a short\ntime only, when a person has means of looking into your cards whom\nyou yourself have described to me some years ago as a most passionate,\ngiddy, imprudent and dangerous woman? I am sure beforehand that\nyour loyalty and devotion has nothing to oppose to the force of my\nexposition. There are, however, some other and minor reasons which\nought likewise to be considered before you come to the determination\nof trusting entirely to possibilities and chance. For the results of\nyour deliberation you will have to come to will in their working and\neffects go beyond yourself, and must affect two other persons. These\nwill have a right to expect that your decision will not be taken\nregardless of that position, which accidental circumstances have\nassigned to them, in an affair the fate of which is placed entirely\nwithin your discretion. This is an additional argument why you should\ndeliberate very conscientiously. A mistake of yours in this respect\nmight by itself produce fresh difficulties and have a complicating and\nperplexing retro effect upon the existing ones; because both, seeing\nthat they must be sufferers in the end, may begin to look only to\ntheir own safety, and become inclined to refuse that passive obedience\nwhich till now constitutes the vehicle of your hazardous enterprize.\nApproaching the conclusion of this letter, I beg to remind you of a\nconversation I had with you on the same subject in South Street, the\n25th of last month. Though you did not avow it then in direct\nwords, I could read from your countenance and manner that you assented\nin your head and heart to all I had said, and in particular to the\nadvice I volunteered at the end of my speech. At that time I pointed\nout to you a period when I thought a decisive step ought to be\ntaken on your part. This period seems to me to have arrived. Placing\nunreserved confidence into your candour and manliness, I remain, for\never, very faithfully yours,\nSTOCKMAR.",

    "body": "Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has had\nthe honour of receiving here your Majesty's letters of yesterday,\nby which he learns with sincere pleasure and satisfaction that your\nMajesty is so much recovered as to go to Windsor on so early a day as\nyour Majesty names. Lord Melbourne hears with great concern that your\nMajesty has been suffering under depression and lowness of spirits....\nLord Melbourne well knows how to feel for those who suffer under it,\nespecially as he has lately had much of it himself.\nLord Melbourne is much rejoiced to hear so good an account of the Heir\nApparent and of the Princess Royal, and feels himself greatly obliged\nby the information respecting the intended names and the sponsors.\nLord Melbourne supposes that your Majesty has determined yourself upon\nthe relative position of the two names, but _Edward_ is a good English\nappellation, and has a certain degree of popularity attached to\nit from ancient recollections. Albert is also an old Anglo-Saxon\nname--the same, Lord Melbourne believes, as Ethelred--but it has not\nbeen so common nor so much in use since the Conquest. However, your\nMajesty's feelings, which Lord Melbourne perfectly understands, must\ndetermine this point. The notion of the King of Prussia gives\ngreat satisfaction here, and will do so with all but Puseyites and\nNewmanites and those who lean to the Roman Catholic faith. His strong\nProtestant feelings, and his acting with us in the matter of the\nSyrian Bishop, have made the King of Prussia highly popular in\nthis country, and particularly with the more religious part of the\ncommunity.\nYour Majesty cannot offer up for the young Prince a more safe and\njudicious prayer than that he may resemble his father. The character,\nin Lord Melbourne's opinion, depends much upon the race, and on both\nsides he has a good chance. Be not over solicitous about education. It\nmay be able to do much, but it does not do so much as is expected from\nit. It may mould and direct the character, but it rarely alters it.\nGeorge IV. and the Duke of York were educated quite like English boys,\nby English schoolmasters, and in the manner and upon the system of\nEnglish schools. The consequence was that, whatever were their faults,\nthey were quite Englishmen. The others, who were sent earlier abroad,\nand more to foreign universities, were not quite so much so. The late\nking was educated as a sailor, and was a complete sailor....\nLord Melbourne will tell your Majesty exactly what he thinks of John\nRussell's reply to the Plymouth address. It is very angry and very\nbitter, and anger and bitterness are never very dignified. Lord\nMelbourne certainly would not have put in those sarcasms upon the Duke\nof Wellington and Sir Robert Peel, for their change of opinion and\nconduct upon the Roman Catholic question. But the tone of the rest\nof the answer is, in Lord Melbourne's opinion, just and right. We\ncertainly delivered the affairs of the country into their hands in a\ngood state, both at home and abroad, and we should be acting unfairly\nby ourselves if we did not maintain and assert this upon every\noccasion. Lord Melbourne's notion of the conduct which he has to\npursue is, that it should not be aggressive, but that it must be\ndefensive. He would oppose no right measures, but he cannot suffer\nthe course of policy which has been condemned in him to be adopted by\nothers without observation upon the inconsistency and injustice....\nLord Melbourne concludes with again wishing your Majesty health and\nhappiness, and much enjoyment of the country.",

If it is discreetly managed,\nit will calm down or blow over or sink into disputes of little\nsignificance. All Lord Melbourne fears is lest the Bishops should be\ninduced to act hastily and should get into the wrong. The Puseyites\nhave the most learning, or rather, have considered the points more\nrecently and more accurately than their opponents.\nLord Melbourne hopes that the Spanish affair will be settled.\nLord Melbourne cannot doubt that the French are wrong. Even if the\nprecedents are in their favour, the Spanish Court has a right to\nsettle its own etiquette and its own mode of transacting business, and\nto change them if it thinks proper.\nLord Melbourne was at Broadlands when the Article to which your\nMajesty alludes appeared in the _Morning Chronicle_, and he talked\nit over with Palmerston. He does not think that Palmerston wrote it,\nbecause there were in it errors, and those errors to Palmerston's\ndisadvantage; but it was written by Easthope under the impression that\nit conveyed Palmerston's notions and opinions. Your Majesty knows very\nwell that Palmerston has long had much communication with the _Morning\nChronicle_ and much influence over it, and has made great use of it\nfor the purpose of maintaining and defending his own policy. In this\nsort of matter there is much to be said upon both sides. A Minister\nhas a great advantage in stating his own views to the public, and if\nPalmerston in the Syrian affair had not had as devoted an assistant\nas the _Morning Chronicle_, he would hardly have been able to maintain\nhis course or carry through his measures. It has always been Lord\nMelbourne's policy to keep himself aloof from the public press and to\nhold it at arm's-length, and he considers it the best course, but\nit is subject to disadvantages. You are never in that case strongly\nsupported by them, nor are the motives and reasons of your conduct\ngiven to the public with that force and distinctness which they might\nbe.\nLord Melbourne has no doubt that your Majesty's assurance is well\nfounded, and that the present Government are anxious for the welfare\nand prosperity and tranquillity of Spain. It cannot be otherwise.\nPalmerston dislikes Aberdeen and has a low opinion of him. He thinks\nhim weak and timid, and likely to let down the character and influence\nof the country. Your Majesty knows that Lord Melbourne does not\npartake these opinions, certainly not at least to anything like the\nextent to which Palmerston carries them.\nLord Melbourne is going down to Panshanger to-morrow, where he\nunderstands that he is to meet Lord and Lady Lansdowne and Lord and\nLady Leveson. Lord Melbourne will take care and say nothing about\nBrighton, but is glad to hear that your Majesty is going thither.",

He is very anxious that Belgium should become _li\u00e9e_ with\nGermany, and I think, dearest Uncle, that it would be for the _real_\ngood of Belgium if it could be so. You will have heard how perfectly\nand splendidly everything went off on the 25th. Nothing could have\ndone better, and _little_ Albert (_what_ a pleasure that he has that\n_dearest_ name!) behaved so well. The King left us yesterday morning\nto go to town, where we follow him to-morrow; he was quite sad to\nleave Windsor, which he admired so much. He dined with the Sutherlands\nyesterday, and dines with the Duke of Wellington to-day, and the\nCambridges to-morrow. On Thursday he dines with us (he lodges in\nBuckingham Palace), and on Friday takes his departure. He is really a\nmost agreeable visitor, though I must own that I am somewhat knocked\nup by our great exertions.\nUncle Ferdinand is very well, and we are delighted with dear\nLeopold; he is so much improved, and is such a modest, sensible\nboy.\nI can't say much for poor Gusti, though I love him, but he is\nreally too odd and inanimate.

Our dear Uncle and dear Cousins have\njust left us, and we are very sorry to see them go; for the longer one\nis together the more intimate one gets, and they were quite become as\nbelonging to us, and were so quiet and unassuming, that we shall\nmiss them much, particularly dear Leopold, whom poor Uncle Ferdinand\nrecommended to my especial care, and therefore am really very anxious\nthat we should settle something for his _future_. Uncle Ferdinand\nlikes the idea of his passing some time at Brussels, and some time\nhere, very much, and I hope we may be able to settle that. Uncle and\nCousins were sorry to go.\nYou will have heard how well our Portsmouth expedition went off; the\nsea was quite smooth on Tuesday, and we had a delightful visit to\nthe _Queen_, which is a splendid ship. I think it is in these immense\nwooden walls that our real greatness exists, and I am proud to think\nthat no _other_ nation _can_ equal us in _this_....\nNow _addio!_ Ever your most affectionate Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

    "body": "Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty. A letter from\nCharles Fox to Lady Holland, and which she has sent to me, informs me\nof the shocking end of Munster, which your Majesty will have heard\nlong before you receive this. Charles Fox attributes it entirely to\nthe vexatious and uneasy life which he led with Lady Munster, but he\nwas always, as your Majesty knows, an unhappy and discontented man,\nand there is something in that unfortunate condition of illegitimacy\nwhich seems to distort the mind and feelings and render them incapable\nof justice or contentment.\nIt is not impossible that upon this event application may be made to\nyour Majesty for the continuance of the pension upon the Privy Purse\nto his son. As Lord Melbourne advised your Majesty to continue these\npensions upon the late King's death, perhaps it may not be improper\nthat he should now say that it is his strong opinion that they should\nnot be continued further. There is no reason for it. They are not\nvery rich, but neither are they poor, and they have very opulent\nconnections and relations. It appears to me that the first opportunity\nshould be taken to show that it is not your Majesty's intention\nto charge the Crown with the maintenance and support of all these\nfamilies, which will otherwise be the case. Lord Melbourne thinks\nit not improper to mention this matter thus early, as otherwise the\n[compassionate] feelings naturally raised by such an event might lead\nto a different determination.\nThere is another matter mentioned in your Majesty's letter, relating\nto money, which is of considerable importance, and that is the\ndetermination taken by your Majesty to subject your own provision\nto the proposed duty on income. When it was put to your Majesty Lord\nMelbourne is disposed to think that your Majesty's determination\nwas right, and it certainly will be very popular, which in the present\ncircumstances of the country and state of public feelings is a great\nadvantage.\nAt the same time it is giving up a principle of the Constitution,\nwhich has hitherto exempted the Sovereign from all direct taxation,\nand there are very great doubts entertained whether the announcement\nto Parliament of the intention was not in a constitutional point of\nview objectionable, inasmuch as it pronounced the opinion of the\nCrown upon a tax which was still under discussion. It is also a great\npecuniary sacrifice, and, as your Majesty says, together with the loss\nof the Duchy of Cornwall and other revenues, will make a great change\nin your Majesty's pecuniary circumstances. These defalcations can only\nbe repaired by care and economy. Your Majesty has all the most right\nfeelings and the best judgment about money, and Lord Melbourne has\nno doubt that your Majesty will so act as to avoid pecuniary\nembarrassment--the only difficulty which Lord Melbourne fears for your\nMajesty, and the only contingency which could involve your Majesty in\nserious personal inconvenience.\nLord Melbourne thanks your Majesty much for the kindness of your\nletter....\nEverybody says that the marriage between Miss Stuart and Lord\nWaterford is likely to take place. It is said that he would do\nalmost anything rather than go to St. Petersburg. Lord Melbourne has\nnot seen Lord Waterford, but he is said to be very good-looking; we\nknow him to be rich and of high rank, and, after all, that sort of\ncharacter is not disliked by all ladies. Perhaps also she counts\nupon the effect of her influence to soften, to tranquillise, and to\nrestrain.\nLord Melbourne hears a very bad account of Lord Anglesey's affairs.\nHis case is a hard one, for these pecuniary difficulties are owing to\nthe extravagance of others, and by no means to his own. Lord Melbourne\nsaw Uxbridge and Ellen at Lady Palmerston's on Saturday evening. The\nlatter seemed in good spirits, and said that she did not mean to shut\nherself up too closely in Hertfordshire.\nLord Melbourne thought that your Majesty would be pleased with\nLambeth. The view from the great window in the drawing-room over the\nriver, and to the Houses of Parliament and the Abbey, is very fine\nindeed, but like all London views can rarely be seen in consequence of\nthe foggy atmosphere....\nNo doubt your Majesty and His Royal Highness must be anxious for a\nlittle quiet and repose, which Lord Melbourne hopes that your Majesty\nwill enjoy. Lord Melbourne had feared that your Majesty's health was\nnot quite so good as it appeared.... Lord Melbourne concludes this\nvery long letter with the most fervent expression of his most sincere\nwishes for your Majesty's health and happiness.\nLord Melbourne in speaking of poor Lord Munster forgot to mention that\nat the Lev\u00e9e on Wednesday last he followed Lord Melbourne down the\nlong gallery as he was going away, came up to him with great emotion\nof manner, pressed his hand warmly, and said that he wished to take\nthe earliest opportunity of thanking Lord Melbourne for all the\nkindness he had shown him whilst he had been in office.",

It rained here hard yesterday in the morning, but cleared\nup about half-past twelve and was very fine indeed. Lord Melbourne\nwent over to Brocket Hall and enjoyed it much. He does not intend\nto return to London until Monday next, when the House of Lords\nreassembles. It is to be hoped that we shall then soon have the Corn\nBill up from the Commons and pass it. The Income Tax will give some\ntrouble, but that done, and the Poor Law Bill, the end of the Session\nmay begin to be looked forward to.\nThe sale of Strawberry Hill naturally excites interest, and things\nare not unlikely to be sold high. The collection has after all\nbeen kept together, and the place has remained in the family of his\nniece, the Duchess of Gloucester, to whom he bequeathed it, longer\nthan he himself expected. He says in one of his letters that he would\nsend a statue down to Linton, Sir Horace Mann's place in Kent, because\nthere it had a better chance of remaining permanently, \"for as to this\npoor bauble of a place,\" he adds, \"it will be knocked to pieces in a\nvery few years after my decease.\" It has stood, however, and remained\nfive-and-forty years, a longer period than he had anticipated. Some\nof the works, such as the bell by Benvenuto Cellini, and the antique\nEagle, are very fine; others are only curious. Lord Melbourne would\nnot give much money for a mere curiosity, unless there were also some\nintrinsic merits or beauty.\nWhat is the value of Cardinal Wolsey's cap, for instance? It was not\ndifferent from that of any other Cardinal, and a Cardinal's cap is no\ngreat wonder.\nLord Melbourne returns Lord Munster's letter. It is without date, but\nwas evidently written in contemplation of the dreadful act which he\nafterwards perpetrated. It is very melancholy. Lord Melbourne\nwas certain that your Majesty would send to Lord Adolphus the\nassurance which you have done, and that you would be anxious to assist\nhis children, and promote their interests by every means in your\npower. But both their brothers and they must be made sensible that\nthey must make some effort for themselves.\nLord Melbourne is very glad to learn that your Majesty intends to\noffer the Round Tower to the Duke of Sussex. It is in every\nrespect kind. It will be of essential service to him, and it will\ngratify him most exceedingly.\nLord Melbourne thinks that your Majesty's decision respecting the\nGoverness is right. It should be a lady of rank; but that she\nshould be a woman of sense and discretion, and capable of fulfilling\nthe duties of the office, is of more importance than whether she is a\nDuchess, a Marchioness, or a Countess. The selection is difficult, but\nif your Majesty can find a person, it would not be well to consider\neither high or low rank as a disqualification.\nLord Melbourne intends to take advantage of his freedom from the\nrestraints of office in order to see a little of the bloom of spring\nand summer, which he has missed for so many years. He has got one or\ntwo horses, which he likes well enough, and has begun to ride again a\nlittle. Lord Melbourne wishes your Majesty much of the same enjoyment,\ntogether with all health, happiness, and prosperity.",

    "body": "Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has this\nmorning received your Majesty's very kind and confidential letter, for\nwhich he greatly thanks your Majesty. Your Majesty may depend upon it\nthat Lord Melbourne will do everything in his power to discourage and\nrestrain factious and vexatious opposition, not only on account of\nyour Majesty's wish, but because he disapproves it as much as your\nMajesty can possibly do. But everything in his power he fears is but\nlittle. The leaders of a party, or those who are so called, have but\nlittle sway over their followers, particularly when not in Government,\nand when they have it not in their power to threaten them with\nany very serious consequences, such as the dissolution of the\nAdministration. Mr Pulteney, afterwards Earl of Bath, is reported to\nhave said that political parties were like snakes, guided not by their\nheads, but by their tails. Lord Melbourne does not know whether this\nis true of the snake, but it is certainly so of the party. The conduct\nof the Opposition upon the resolution respecting the Income Tax is\nrendered peculiarly ridiculous by the result. They forcibly put it off\nuntil after the holidays, and then upon the first day of the meeting\nthey vote it without a division. What is this but admitting that they\nlooked to a movement in the country which they have not been able to\ncreate? Moreover, all Oppositions that Lord Melbourne has ever seen\nare more or less factious. The Opposition of Mr Fox to Mr Pitt was the\nleast so, but these were great men, greater than any that exist at\nthe present day, although Lord Melbourne is by no means inclined to\ndepreciate his own times. The factiousness of one Opposition naturally\nproduces the same in the next. They say, \"They did so to us; why\nshould we not do so to them?\" Your Majesty may rest assured that\nLord Melbourne will do everything he can to prevent delay, and to\naccelerate the transaction of the public business.\nLord Melbourne sends a letter which he has received this morning from\nthe Duke of Sussex, and which expresses very right and proper feeling.\nLord Melbourne has written in reply that, \"Your Majesty was no doubt\ninfluenced principally by your natural affection for him, and by your\nsense of the generosity of his conduct towards Lord Munster, but that\nif any thought of Lord Melbourne intervened, your Majesty could not\nhave given a higher or a more acceptable proof of your approbation and\nregard.\"\nThe Garters seem to Lord Melbourne to be given well enough. Your\nMajesty's feelings upon the subject are most kind and amiable. But\nthese things cannot be helped, and it is upon the whole advantageous\nthat each party should have their portion of patronage and honours.\nIf there is very distinguished service, the Garter should be bestowed\nupon it. Otherwise, in Lord Melbourne's opinion, it is better given\nto noblemen of high rank and great property. The chapter in\nEcclesiasticus, read in St George's Chapel on Obiit Sunday, well\ndescribes those who ought to have it, with the exception of those \"who\nfind out musical tunes.\" Lord Melbourne does not think it well given\nto Ministers. It is always then subject to the imputation of their\ngiving it to themselves, and pronouncing an approbation of their own\nconduct.\nLord Melbourne hopes that the Pope's standing sponsor for the young\nPrince of Portugal is a sign of complete reconciliation with the See\nof Rome. It is a very awkward thing for a Roman Catholic Government to\nbe at variance with the Pope. He is still a very ugly customer.\nLord Melbourne is very much concerned to hear of the Baron's\nillness--very much indeed; he is an excellent and most valuable man,\nwith one of the soundest and coolest judgments that Lord Melbourne has\never met with. Your Majesty knows that Lord Melbourne has never had\na favourable opinion of his health. There seems to be about him a\nsettled weakness of the stomach, which is in fact the seat of health,\nstrength, thought and life. Lord Melbourne sees that a great physician\nsays that Napoleon lost the battle of Leipsic in consequence of some\nvery greasy soup which he ate the day before, and which clouded his\njudgment and obscured his perceptions.\nLord Melbourne is very glad to hear that your Majesty has amused\nyourself so well in the country, and is not surprised that you are\nunwilling to quit it. He means himself to see a little of the coming\nin of the spring, which he has not done for many years.",

Lord Melbourne also believes it to be very\npopular, for the reasons which your Majesty mentions.\nYour Majesty having generally chosen handsome and attractive girls for\nthe Maids of Honour, which is very right, must expect to lose them in\nthis way.

    "body": "MY DEAREST UNCLE.--I wish to be the first to inform you of what\nhappened yesterday evening, and to tell you that we are _saines et\nsauves_. On returning from the chapel on Sunday, Albert was observing\nhow civil the people were, and then suddenly turned to me and said it\nappeared to him as though a man had held out a pistol to the carriage,\nand that it had hung fire; accordingly, when we came home he mentioned\nit to Colonel Arbuthnot, who was only to tell it to Sir J. Graham and\nSir Robert Peel, and have the police instructed, and _nobody else_.\nNo one, however, who was with us, such as footmen, etc., had seen\nanything at all. Albert began to doubt what he believed he had seen.\nWell, yesterday morning (Monday) a lad came to Murray (who of\ncourse knew nothing) and said that he saw a man in the crowd as\nwe came home from church, present a pistol to the carriage, which,\nhowever, did not go off, and heard the man say, \"Fool that I was not\nto fire!\" The man then vanished, and this boy followed another man\n(an old man) up St James's Street who repeated twice, \"How very\nextraordinary!\" but instead of saying anything to the police, asked\nthe boy for his direction and disappeared. The boy accordingly was\nsent to Sir Robert Peel, and (doubtful as it all still was) every\nprecaution was taken, still keeping the thing completely secret, not\na soul in the house knowing a word, and accordingly after some\nconsultation, as _nothing_ could be done, we drove out--many police\nthen in plain clothes being distributed in and about the parks, and\nthe two Equerries riding so close on each side that they must have\nbeen hit, if anybody had; still the feeling of looking out for such a\nman was not _des plus agr\u00e9ables_; however, we drove through the parks,\nup to Hampstead, and back again. All was so quiet that we almost\nthought of nothing,--when, as we drove down Constitution Hill, very\nfast, we heard the report of a pistol, but not at all loud, so that\nhad we not been on the alert we should hardly have taken notice of\nit. We saw the man seized by a policeman _next to whom he was standing\nwhen he_ fired, but we did not stop. Colonel Arbuthnot and two others\nsaw him take aim, but we only _heard_ the report (looking both the\nother way). We felt both very glad that our drive had had the effect\nof having the man seized. Whether it was loaded or not we cannot yet\ntell, but we are again full of gratitude to Providence for invariably\n_protecting_ us! The feeling of horror is very great in the public,\nand great affection is shown us. The man was yesterday examined at the\nHome Office, is called John Francis, is a cabinet-maker, and son of a\nmachine-maker of Covent Garden Theatre, is good-looking (they say). I\nhave never seen him at all close, but Arbuthnot gave the description\nof him from what he saw on Sunday, which exactly answered. Only twenty\nor twenty-one years old, and _not_ the _least_ mad--but very cunning.\nThe boy identified him this morning, amongst many others. Everything\nis to be kept secret _this_ time, which is very right, and altogether\nI think it is being well done. Every further particular you shall\nhear. I was really not at all frightened, and feel _very_ proud at\ndear Uncle Mensdorff calling me \"_sehr muthig_,\" which I shall ever\nremember with peculiar pride, coming from so distinguished an officer\nas he is! Thank God, my Angel is also well! but he says that had\nthe man fired on Sunday, he must have been hit in the head! God is\nmerciful; that indeed we must feel daily more! Uncle and cousins were\nquite horrified.... Ever your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.\nYou will tell Louise _all_, of course.",

Lord\nMelbourne is very glad to hear that your Majesty has enjoyed in the\nsociety of your near and dear relations so much happiness, which, like\nall other things, must have its portion of alloy in their departure.\nLord Melbourne was much pleased with the short conversation which\nhe had with Count Mensdorff at Stafford House, and it is highly\ninteresting to see at this distance of time a man who has been engaged\nin affairs so important and of so awful and melancholy a character.\nYour Majesty is surely right in terming your cousins young men; if\nthe health and constitution be good, thirty-six is a young man,\ntwenty-nine and thirty-two very young men, and twenty-five quite a\nboy. The weather has been very hot but very fine. The rain was so much\nrequired that Lord Melbourne cannot lament its coming, but he also\nregrets the hot suns which it has banished.\nThe course which had been taken upon the Income Tax in the House of\nCommons, contrary to Lord Melbourne's wish and opinion, rendered\nit impossible for Lord Melbourne directly to support the Bill in the\nHouse of Lords without offending and separating himself from the whole\nbody of those who supported the last Government.\nHe therefore acquiesced in the resolution, which was moved by Lord\nLansdowne, and which did not oppose the measure, but declared that it\nmight have been avoided if the course which we had proposed had been\ntaken. In the debate Lord Melbourne argued as strongly as he could in\nfavour of the tax, and ended by declaring that if it was imposed, he\ncould not pledge himself for the future against maintaining and even\nextending it. Lord Melbourne is anxious to make this explanation of\nhis conduct to your Majesty, and hopes therefore that your Majesty\nwill forgive his writing thus much upon this subject. Lord Melbourne\nvery much lamented that the business did not terminate as amiably as\nit began, and that a contest should have been got into respecting the\nthird reading of the Bill; but considering that the measure had passed\nby accident through its first stages without any debate, and that\nthere were Lords who were still desirous of speaking upon it, it was\nimprudent of the Ministers not at once to give another day for that\npurpose, especially as they were sure to be compelled to do so by\nrepeated motions of adjournment.\nThe feelings which your Majesty expresses upon the conviction of this\nman are natural, and such as must arise in your Majesty's bosom;\nbut Lord Melbourne knows very well that your Majesty will at once see\nthe necessity of not yielding to your own feelings, and of leaving the\nissue entirely in the hands of your advisers.\nWithout any reference to personal or particular circumstances, without\nadverting to your Majesty's age, sex, qualities mental or personal,\nwithout attending to any sentiments of attachment or affection which\nmay be felt for your Majesty's person, it must be remembered that your\nMajesty's life is, from the position which you occupy and the office\nwhich you fill, the most important life in these realms; it is also\ntoo clear that it is the most exposed life in the country, the life\nthe most obnoxious to danger; and therefore it is a duty to throw\naround it every protection which the law and the execution of the law\ncan afford.\nLord Melbourne was sure that your Majesty, being fond of speed, would\nbe delighted with the railway. Lord Melbourne hopes that your Majesty\nwas not much affected by the heat, which he feared that you would be.\nHas your Majesty read the last volume of Madame D'Arblay's (Miss\nBurney) Diary, which contains the account of her service in the family\nof George III.?

The King of the Belgians has never dropped a word on\nthe subject, but the Queen really feels it her duty by her Uncle to\nstate this frankly to Sir Robert Peel, and to say that she thinks it\nhighly important that Sir Edward Disbrowe should be removed to some\nother Mission. Of course she wishes that this should be done\nquietly, but she thinks that with a man like the present King of the\nNetherlands, who is continually intriguing in Belgium and making her\nUncle's position very painful, it is of the utmost importance that\nour Minister there should be totally _unbiassed_--which Sir Edward\nDisbrowe most decidedly is not. Could not Sir T. Cartwright be sent\nthere, and Sir Edward Disbrowe go to Stockholm? The Queen merely\nsuggests this; but, of course, as long as the man sent to the Hague is\nsensible and _fair_, it is indifferent to her who goes there....",

This is the reason why I now venture to ask whether a similar\nkindness might be shown the accompanying little poem, supposing\nno etiquette to stand in the way of it. I have no Tory channels of\ncommunication with the Palace, nor wish to seek any; neither can I\ntrespass upon any friendships of Her Majesty's, unless they can find\nmy excuse in some previous knowledge of me. On the other hand, I have\nno fear of being supposed by your Lordship to approach one who is no\nlonger Premier with less respect than when he was in power. I would\neven venture to say, if the mode of testifying it were not so poor a\none, that it is in a double spirit of respectfulness the application\nis made. Should it be of a nature calculated to give your Lordship any\nperplexity, I can only blush for having been the occasion of it, and\nbeg it may be laid to the account of an ignorance which lives very\nmuch out of the world. The same reason will plead my excuse for\nnot knowing whether a letter to Her Majesty ought, or ought not, to\naccompany the book; and for begging your Lordship, after its perusal,\nto suppress it or otherwise accordingly, in case you can oblige me\nin the other part of my request. Your Lordship will perceive that the\nAddress prefixed to the poem, not having ventured to ask Her Majesty's\npermission, does not presume to call itself a dedication; neither does\nit leave the public under any erroneous impression whatsoever as to\nthe nature of its intentions: and on this account I not only expect,\nof course, no acknowledgment of its receipt on the part of any\none about Her Majesty's person, but shall be more than content to\nunderstand by your Lordship's own silence that my book has reached its\ndestination, and therefore not been considered altogether unworthy of\nit.\nThe bookseller tells me that it is no longer \"the mode\" for authors to\npresent their volumes _bound_; but in regard to books intended to go\nto Court, he is not quite so certain; and I find it so difficult to\ndisassociate the idea of dress from any such proceeding, that I trust\nmy inexperience in this respect also will procure me whatever pardon\nit may require.\nI have the honour to be, my Lord, your Lordship's ever grateful and\nfaithful Servant,\nLEIGH HUNT.",

    "body": "MY BELOVED VICTORIA,--I was unable to thank you the other day for your\nkind and feeling letter of the 14th, although I was greatly touched\nby it, and I trust you will have excused me. I thank you to-day very\nsincerely for both your letters, and for the share and sympathy you\nand dear Albert take in our _great misfortune_. I know it is very\nheart-felt, and we are all very grateful for it. Victoire and my poor\nmother have already given you news from the unfortunate H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\nShe has sustained and outlived the first shock and shows wonderful\ncourage. She is even well in health, and much better and stronger\nin all ways than I had expected. She takes very much upon herself\non account of the poor children, to prevent that any melancholy or\npainful feeling should be connected for them with the remembrance of\ntheir beloved and unfortunate father. My parents show great fortitude\nand resignation, but their hearts are for ever broke. They are only\nsustained by their feeling of duty. My poor mother bears up for my\nfather, and my father bears up to fulfil his duties of father and of\nking. Their health is, thank God! good, and my father retains all his\nstrength of mind and quickness of judgment; but they are both grown\nold in looks, and their hairs are turned quite white.\nThe first days, my poor father could do nothing but sob, and it was\nreally heartbreaking to see him. He begins now to have more command\nupon his grief, and the presence of your uncle, whom he dearly loves,\nseems to do him good. The poor children are well and _merry_ and seem\nunconscious of their dreadful loss. From time to time only they jump\nround us as if looking for protection. The contrast of their gaiety\nwith their horrid misfortune is very painful. Paris is looking\nremarkably well and strong. Robert is much grown, extremely quick\nand lively, and begins to speak. The remainder of the family is,\nas you may easily imagine, in the _deepest affliction_. Nemours\nespecially is quite broken down with grief. Chartres was _more_ than\na _brother_ to him, as he was _more_ than a _second father_ to us all.\nHe was the _head_ and the _heart_ and _soul_ of the whole family. We\nall looked up to him, and we found him on all occasions. A _better_,\nor even _such_ a brother was never seen; our loss is as great as\nirreparable; but God's will be done! He had surely His motives in\nsending on my unfortunate parents the horrid affliction in their\nold days, and in removing from us the being who seemed the _most\nnecessary_ to the hope and happiness of all; we must submit to His\ndecrees, hard as they are; but it is impossible not to regret that my\npoor brother has not at least found the death of a soldier, which\nhe had always wished for, instead of such a useless, horrid, and\nmiserable one! It seems, for no one saw him fall, that he did not\njump, as we had thought at first, but that he was thrown from the\nbarouche, while standing; and I like it in some measure better so, as\nGod's will is still more manifest in this way. It is equally manifest\nin _all_ the circumstances attending the catastrophe. My poor brother\nwas not even to have come to Neuilly. He had taken leave of my parents\nthe day before, and would not have gone again if my unfortunate mother\nhad not asked him, and if my parents, who were to go to Paris, had not\ndelayed their departure....\nI thank you again and again, my beloved Victoria, for all your\ninterest and sympathy. I was sure you would think of us and of me: you\nknow how much I loved my brother. I little expected to outlive him, as\nI had done my beloved Mary; but once more, _God's will be done_. I\nremain now and ever, yours most devotedly,\nLOUISE.\nI perceive I forgot mentioning Ernest. Pray thank him for his sympathy\nalso. He knows what a brother is, and may feel for us! We expect on\nSaturday poor Joinville. My father will have thus his four remaining\nsons round him for the opening of the Session, which takes place on\nthe 26th, and at which he must preside in person. It is a hard duty\nfor him.",

    "body": "MY DEAREST VICTORIA,--I was anxious to write to you on the 18th, but\nI was so overpowered with all that surrounded me that I could really\nnot. Yesterday I received your dear letter of the 19th, and I will\nanswer it, so as to give you a clear view of the sad case. On the\n12th, Tuesday, Chartres had taken leave, as he meant to go to St Omer,\nthe 13th; however, in the family the Queen and others said he ought to\ncome once more to see them. The King had ordered his carriage to go to\ntown on the 13th, to a Council; Chartres meant to have called shortly\nafter ten.\nIt is necessary to tell you all this, as it shows how strangely\ncircumstances turned fatally. Chartres did not want to return once\nmore to Neuilly, and the King, if exact, might see him once more\nin town. Chartres, however, instead of coming early, set off after\neleven; his Off. d'Ordonnance, M. Bertin de Veaux, his _valet de\nchambre_, a German, Holder, begged him not to go quite alone in that\nsmall phaeton through Paris, as he was in uniform, but all this did\nnot avail; he insisted to go in the phaeton and to go _alone_. He set\nout later than he expected, and if the King had set out _exactly_ as\nhe had named, the parents and the son would probably have met on the\nrising avenue of the Champs Elysees, towards the Barri\u00e8re de l'\u00c9toile\nand Arc de Triomphe. However, the King delayed his departure and the\nson set off. At the place where from the great avenue one turns off\ntowards Neuilly, the horses, which were not even young horses, as I am\ntold that he has had them some years, moved by that stupid longing to\nget to Neuilly, where they knew their stables, got rather above\nthe postillion, and ran _quasi_ away. Chartres got up and asked the\npostillion if he could hold his horses no longer; the boy called out\n\"Non, Monseigneur\"; he had looked back when he said this, and saw his\nmaster for the last time _standing_ in the phaeton. People at some\ndistance saw him come out of his carriage and describe a sort of\nsemicircle falling down. Nobody knows exactly if he jumped out of the\ncarriage, or if he lost his position and fell out. I am inclined to\nthink that, trusting to his lightness and agility, he wanted to jump\nout, forgetting the impulse which a quick-going carriage gives, as\nthere were marks on his knees as if he had first fallen that way. The\nprincipal blow was, however, on the head, the skull being entirely\nfractured. He was taken up senseless, that is to say confused, but\nnot fainting, and carried into a small inn. At first his appearance,\nsitting in a chair, was so little altered that people thought it was\nnothing of any consequence.\nHe _knew_ no one, and only spoke a few incoherent words in German. The\naccident happened about a quarter before twelve, and at four he was no\nmore.\nI refer for some other details to Albert. Poor Louise looks like a\nshadow, and only her great devotion for me supports her. It may serve\nas a lesson how fragile all human affairs are. Poor Chartres, it\nseems, with the prospect of these camps and altogether, was _never\nin better spirits_. But I must end. Ever, my dearest Victoria, your\ndevoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

Lord and Lady\nPalmerston are coming down to-morrow, and Lord and Lady Cowper will\nprobably come over from Panshanger.\nYour Majesty read extremely well in the House of Lords on Friday\nlast. Lord Melbourne can judge better of this from the body of the\nHouse than he could when he stood close to your Majesty. Nothing can\nbe more clear and distinct, and at the same time more natural and free\nfrom effort. Perhaps if your Majesty could read a tone louder it would\nbe as well. Charles Buller, who was amongst the House of Commons, told\nLord Melbourne that, where he stood, the voice, although well heard,\nsounded somewhat weak. But this should not be attempted unless it\ncan be done with perfect ease. Nothing injures reading so much as the\nattempt to push the organ beyond its natural powers.\nLord Melbourne hopes that these tumults in the manufacturing districts\nare subsiding, but he cannot conceal from your Majesty that he views\nthem with great alarm--much greater than he generally thinks it\nprudent to express. He fears that they may last in the form of strike,\nand turn out much longer than is looked for, as they did in 1832 and\n1833.\nThere is a great mass of discontented feeling in the country arising\nfrom the actual state of society. It arises from the distress and\ndestitution which will fall at times upon a great manufacturing\npopulation, and from the wild and extravagant opinions which are\nnaturally generated in an advanced and speculative state of society.\nThis discontent has been aggravated and fermented by the language of\nevery party in the state. Lord Melbourne can exempt no party from\nthis blame, nor hardly any individual except himself. The Tories and\nConservatives (not the Leaders, but the larger portion of the party)\nhave done what they could to inflame the public mind upon that most\ninflammable topic of the Poor Laws. The _Times_ newspaper has been the\nmost forward in this. The Whigs and Radicals have done what they could\nin the same direction upon the Corn Laws. Mr Attwood and another\nset have worked the question of the Currency, and the whole career of\nMr O'Connell in Ireland has been too manifest to be mistaken. It is\nno wonder if working in this manner altogether they have at last\nsucceeded in driving the country into this which is certainly very\nnear, if not actually a rebellion.\nLord Melbourne earnestly hopes that your Majesty and the Prince, the\nPrince, and Princess are all well.",

We are much rejoiced here that your\nMajesty saw the Prince and Princess Liechtenstein. The latter is a\ngreat favourite of Lady Beauvale's, to whom she was always very kind,\nand who describes her exactly as your Majesty does, as being very\n\"amiable and unassuming,\" and though one of the first, if not the\nfirst lady at Vienna, as not at all partaking of the insolence and\nhauteur which is by some ascribed to the society of that capital. As\na beauty, she is perhaps upon too large a scale, except for those who\nadmire women of all shapes and sizes; but her eyes and brow are very\nfine, and there is a very peculiarly soft and radiant expression about\nthem. Lord Melbourne had heard of his Sovereignty, but understands\nthat his territory is extremely limited. His possessions as a subject\nof Austria are worth a good deal more than his German principality.\nLord Melbourne greatly congratulates your Majesty upon the happy\nprogress and termination of the expedition to Scotland. He is very\nglad of three things--that your Majesty returned by sea, in the\nsteamer, and that the passage was a good one....\nThe country is indeed most interesting, full of real picturesque\nbeauty and of historical and poetical associations and recollections.\nThere is nothing to detract from it, except the very high opinion\nthat the Scotch themselves entertain of it. Edinburgh is\nmagnificent--situation, buildings, and all--but the boasting of the\narticles in the newspapers respecting it almost inclined one to deny\nits superiority. It is also, as your Majesty says, most striking to\ncontemplate in the Clans the remains of feudal times and institutions.\nIt is quite as well, however, particularly for Monarchy, that they are\nbut remains, and that no more of them have been left.\nLord Melbourne thanks your Majesty much for your kind enquiries after\nhis health. He thinks that he is getting better and stronger than he\nhas been, and has a notion of trying a little shooting in October.\nLord Melbourne begs to be respectfully remembered to the Prince.",

Hallam's work certainly requires much consideration\nand much explanation, but it is a fair, solid, impartial work, formed\nupon much thought and much reading. St Simon's is an excellent\nwork; he has some prejudices, but was a good honest man, and his\nbook is full of useful information. If your Majesty wishes for a book\nrelating to what passed from one hundred to two hundred years ago,\nLord Melbourne would strongly recommend the Private Memoirs of the\nLord Chancellor Clarendon (Edward Hyde), not the great work, _The\nHistory of the Rebellion_, though that is well worth reading, but the\n_Memoirs_, and Bishop Burnet's History of his own time. The reigns\nof Charles II., James II., and the Revolution are very curious in\nthe latter. During Queen Anne's reign the Bishop was not so much\nconsulted, and his work is therefore not so interesting. If your\nMajesty wishes to turn your attention to more recent events, Professor\nSmyth's lectures upon Modern History, and particularly upon\nthe French Revolution, seem to Lord Melbourne sound, fair, and\ncomprehensive. Lord Mahon's is also a good work, and gives a good\naccount of the reigns of George I. and George II. He has been thought\nby some in his last volume to have given too favourable a character of\nthe Chevalier, Charles Edward Stuart.\nLord Melbourne is much touched by what your Majesty says of the\nPrincess Royal, and the delight and comfort which your Majesty finds\nin her, as well as by the whole picture which your Majesty draws of\nyour domestic happiness. When your Majesty refers to what passed\nthree years ago, your Majesty may be assured that it is with no small\npleasure that Lord Melbourne recalls any share which he may have had\nin that transaction, and congratulates himself as well as your Majesty\nand the Prince upon results which have been so fortunate both for\nyourselves and for the country.

Your\nopinion respecting George of Hanover's marriage is quite my own,\nand I regret that the King does not seem to be inclined to settle it\nand fix a day for the celebration of it. I do not know his reasons\nagainst it, for I have not heard from him for a long, long time. I am\nso sorry to find that the accounts of his health are so indifferent,\nand fear he is not careful enough.\nI am happy to hear that you thought the Cambridge visit went off well,\nand that the affianced looked and seemed happy. I hope it will\nalways be the same, and that the marriage will not be delayed too\nlong. I always had imagined that the Duke of Cambridge was rich and\nwould give a fortune to his daughters, but I have lately heard that it\nis not the case. I do not know what is the usual marriage portion of\nan English Princess given by the country. In Germany those portions\nare called _die Prinzessin Teuer_.\nWe received 25,000 Fl. each when we married, and 10,000 Fl. for our\n_trousseaux_ each.\nIf the young couple are to live in future with the Grand Duke they\nwill not want any Plate, but if they are to have a separate _m\u00e9nage_,\nthen they will want it. I shall find it out by and by. I wonder that\nthe Duchess likes to part with her fine sapphires. I thought the\nturquoises had been intended for Augusta.\nI wish you could see the Convent to which I went the other day. The\nnuns belong to the Order of the Cistercian _Trappists_. They are not\nallowed to speak amongst themselves--what a relief my visit must\nhave been to them!--and they neither eat meat, nor butter, nor\neggs--nothing but milk, vegetables and rice. They look healthy, and\nthere were several young rather pretty ones amongst them. One, the\nbest-looking of them all, Sister Marie Josepha, took me affectionately\nby the hand and said, \"I hope the air agrees with you here and that\nyou feel better?\" and then she added, \"Come again--will you, before\nyou leave this country again?\" She told me that she was born in\nIreland and had a German grandfather. She seemed to be the favourite\namongst them all, for when I bought of their works and asked them to\nmake up my bill, they called Marie Josepha to summon it up, and she\nsaid to me, \"Do not stay for that; we will send you your things with\nthe bill.\" Two hours after my visit to them I received my things, with\na wreath of flowers besides as their gift to me; on the paper attached\nto it was written, \"To the Queen-Dowager, from the Reverend Mother and\nher Community.\"\nThis old Reverend Mother, the Abbess, was very infirm, and could not\nget up from her chair, but she spoke very politely and ladylike to me\nin French. She has been forty years in her present _situation_,\nand comes from Bretagne. The chaplain of the Convent is also an old\nFrenchman, and there are several other French nuns amongst them--one\nwho had been condemned to be guillotined in the Revolution, and was\nset at liberty just at the moment the execution was to have taken\nplace. I should like to know whether these good nuns resumed again at\nonce their silence when I left them, or whether they were permitted to\ntalk over the events of that day.... Your most affectionately devoted\nAunt,\nADELAIDE.",

Clear, dry frost would be wholesome.\nVictoire gave me yesterday a much better account of poor little\nRobert.\nIn Portugal affairs seem quieted down, but Ferdinand is imprudent\nenough to say to Mamma that he would be wretched to lose Dietz (very\nnaturally), and _would not be at all sorry to go away_. Now, this is\n_folly_, and a most dangerous language to hold, as if he entertains\nthis, I fear the Portuguese will _some beau matin_ indulge him in his\nwishes.\nThe news from Spain are better, but I must own frankly to you, that\n_we are all disgusted_ at the _French intrigues_ which have _without\na doubt_ been at the bottom of it all, and can, I fear, be traced\nvery close to the Tuileries. Why attempt to ruin a country (which they\nluckily _cannot succeed_ in) merely out of personal dislike to a man\nwho certainly has proved himself capable of keeping the country quiet,\nand certainly is by far the _most honest_ Spaniard in existence,\nwhatever crimes or faults the French may choose to bring against him.\nAnd what will be the effect of all this? A total dislike and mistrust\nof France, and a still closer alliance with England. I have spoken\nthus freely, as a repetition of last year's scenes is _too much_ to\nremain silent, and as I have ever been privileged to tell you, dearest\nUncle, my feelings, and the truth.\nPoor Lord Hill's death, though fully expected, will grieve you, as it\nhas grieved us.\nI am much amused at what you say about Charles, and shall tell it him,\nwhen I write to him. Believe me, always, your most affectionate Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

It is a very good book.\nAdolphus's History is by no means a bad book, and will give your\nMajesty the facts of the beginning of the reign of George III. well\nand accurately enough. The Duke of Sussex once told Lord Melbourne\nthat he had asked his father whether Adolphus's account of the\nbeginning of his reign was correct, and that the King had replied that\nsubstantially it was so, but that there were some mistakes, and that\nwhat had been done by one person was often attributed to another.\nAdolphus's History will receive some illustration from Horace\nWalpole's letters of that period....\nLord Melbourne thinks that he is really getting rid of the gout, and\ngathering strength.

Some impression was made at the moment; but his general\ndemeanour is marked by cold reserve and hardness of heart.",

    "body": "Lord Melbourne presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and thanks\nmuch for the letter of the 30th ult., which he received here yesterday\nmorning. He believes it is more prudent not to go to London, but he\ngreatly regrets that his not doing so will deprive him for so long a\ntime of the honour and pleasure of seeing your Majesty.\nThe Duke of Sussex acquainted Lord Melbourne and took his opinion\nbefore he issued his cards for the dinner. Lord Melbourne does not\nthink that he can have any idea of playing the part to which Lord\nErroll alluded. It is better that a dinner should be given somewhere.\nHe having nothing of the kind would look too much like giving up\nthe whole business and disbanding the party. Lord Melbourne entirely\nagrees with your Majesty as to the political conduct which ought to be\npursued by the members of the Royal Family, but he remembers no time\nin which they have been induced to act with so much prudence and\npropriety. Your Majesty will see in Adolphus the very prominent share\nwhich the Duke of Cumberland, the General of Culloden, took in the\nParty contentions of those days. He was a strong partisan and in a\ngreat measure the founder of the Whig party. Lord Melbourne has often\nheard George IV. converse upon that subject, and he used to contend\nthat it was quite impossible for a Prince of Wales in this country to\navoid taking an active part in politics and political contentions. The\nfact is, that George III. did not discourage this in his own family\nsufficiently, and the King of Hanover always said that his father had\nencouraged him in the active part which he took, and which certainly\nwas sufficiently objectionable.\nThe assassination of Drummond is indeed a horrible event. Lord\nMelbourne does not see as yet any clear, distinct, and certain\nevidence of what were the real motives and object of the man. But we\nshall hear upon his trial what it is that he urges. Your Majesty will,\nof course, recollect that the Jury acquitted Oxford, and there then\nwas nothing to do but to acquiesce in the verdict. If the Jury should\ntake a similar view of this man's crime, it will be impossible for\nthe Government to do anything to remedy the evil which Lord Melbourne\nthinks will be caused by such a decision. Lord Melbourne knew Mr\nDrummond pretty well. He used formerly to be much in Hertfordshire,\nboth at Hatfield and at Gorhambury, and Lord Melbourne has often met\nhim at both places, and thought him with all the rest of the world, a\nvery quiet, gentlemanly, and agreeable man. Lord Melbourne very well\nremembers the murder of Mr Perceval and Bellingham's trial. Lord\nMelbourne was then in the House of Commons, but was not present at the\ntime the crime was perpetrated. There were differences of opinion as\nto the manner in which Sir James Mansfield conducted the trial. Many\nthought that he ought to have given more time, which was asked for\non the part of the prisoner, in order to search for evidence at\nLiverpool. But the law which he laid down in his charge is certainly\nsound, correct, and reasonable. Lord Melbourne is very glad to think\nthat your Majesty has not to go to the House of Lords to-day.",

The contrary is certainly\nthe case. There is much of popular objection to him from his American\nconnection and his supposed strong American interests. Lady Ashburton,\nwith whom he received a large fortune, is a born American. But he is\nsupposed to possess much funded property in that country, and to\nhave almost as strong an interest in its welfare as in that of Great\nBritain.

It seems to Lord\nMelbourne that what with Ellenborough with the Gates of Ghuznee upon\nhis shoulders, and Ashburton with the American Treaty round his\nneck, the Ministry have nearly as heavy a load upon them as they can\nstand up under, and Lord Melbourne would not be surprised if they were\nto lighten themselves of one or the other.",

He means the part relating to the character and\nsituation of a Prince of Wales in this country. George IV. was so\nconscious of having mixed himself most unrestrainedly in politics,\nand of having taken a very general part in opposition to his father's\nGovernment and wishes, that he was naturally anxious to exonerate\nhimself from blame, and to blame it upon the necessity of his position\nrather than upon his own restless and intermeddling disposition.

But Lord\nMelbourne has taken to going down to dinner with those who are in the\nhouse, and sitting up afterwards until near twelve o'clock, and since\nhe has done this he has slept better. We expect the Duke and Duchess\nof Bedford for two nights on Wednesday next.

George\nByng came the other morning in a waistcoat of Peel's velveteen.\nLord Strafford brought the whole piece off the manufacturer, and let\nGeorge Byng have enough for a waistcoat.

It will probably answer every purpose\nto state that they shall be considered _equivalent_, and when your\nMajesty shall hold a Lev\u00e9e it may be then notified at the time that\nsecond presentations are not necessary.\nWhen the Prince shall hold the Lev\u00e9e, it may be made known at the\ntime, without any formal public notification, that kneeling and the\nkissing of hands will not be required.\nSir Robert Peel hopes that the effect of holding these Lev\u00e9es may be\nmaterially to relieve your Majesty, but it is of course difficult to\nspeak with certainty. He was under the impression that in the reign of\nQueen Anne, Prince George had occasionally held Lev\u00e9es on the part\nof the Queen during the Queen's indisposition, but on searching the\n_Gazette_ of the time he cannot find any record of this.",

Nobody would complain of or contend\nagainst it.\nBut there will be no end of the complaints of interference by\nauthority on the part of Freemasons, and of those who will take part\nwith the Duchess of Inverness: and it is a curious fact that there\nare persons in Society who are interested in making out that she was\nreally married to the Duke. Against this we must observe that it\nwill be urged that the omission to insist that the interment should\ntake place in the Collegiate Chapel of St George's, Windsor, and thus\nto set aside the will, lowers the Royal Family in the opinion of the\npublic, and is a concession to Radicalism. But it is my opinion that\nthe reasons will justify that which will be done in conformity with\nthe will.\nI confess that I don't like to decide upon cases in such haste; and\nI cannot consider it necessary that a decision should be made on the\ncourse to be taken in respect to the Duke's funeral, on the morrow of\nthe day on which he died.\nIt would be desirable to know the opinion of the Lord Chancellor, the\nArchbishop, and others.\nI can't think of anything likely to occur, which might alter me: and\nI'll abide by that which I have above given.\nIt will be absolutely necessary to take effective measures for the\npreservation of the peace at this funeral at Kensal Green: and\neven that the magistrates should superintend the procession of the\nFreemasons.

Louise writes to me about the Duke of Bordeaux\ncoming to England making some difficulty, and I wish therefore to\nstate what we know of the affair. We _understand_ (for of course\nwe have had no direct communication) that the Duc de Bordeaux has\nembarked at Hamburg for _Hull_, and intends travelling in Scotland\n_before_ he visits England, and _that_ incognito and under the name of\nComte _tel et tel_; his being in Scotland when Nemours is in\nEngland, and particularly _on a visit to us here_, _could_ make\n_no_ difficulty, and even if he were travelling about _incognito_ in\nEngland, it could not signify, I think. Moreover, I feel certain that\nif he knew that _I_ had invited the Nemours and that they were coming\nover shortly, he would go away, as the Legitimists would not be\npleased at Nemours being _f\u00eated_ by me--_while their Henry V._ was\n_not_ even noticed or received. I could easily, and indeed have almost\ndone so, make it known generally that _I_ expect the Nemours, and I\nwould say _immediately_, and he would be sure to get out of the way.\nI cannot tell you _how very_ anxious we are to see the Nemours; I have\nbeen thinking of nothing else, and to lose this great pleasure would\nbe too mortifying. Moreover, as I really and truly do not think it\nneed be, it would be _best_ if the Nemours could come _before_ the\n10th of November; which is the _latest_ term when they could come? Now\npray, dearest Uncle, do settle this for me; you have no notion _how_\nwe wish it. I will be sure to let you know what I hear, and if there\nis anything you could suggest about this, I need not say but that we\nshall attend to it with pleasure. The Grand Duke Michael will be gone\nby the end of this month. _Ainsi je mets cette ch\u00e8re visite dans vos\nmains._ Ever your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.\nPray, dearest Uncle, let me have an answer by the next post about\nthis, as I am all in a _fidget_ about it.",

The Queen and myself think that the\nuncertainty of his being received at Court or not is doing harm, and\nwould _much_ wish, therefore, that it was _decidedly_ stated _that\nthe Queen will not receive him_. His coming here without ever asking\n(indeed knowing that it was disliked), as well as the part which\nAustria and Prussia seem to have taken in the matter, do not\nstrengthen his claim for such a favour. No good can come from the\nreception, and the King of the French must prefer its not taking\nplace. Let us, therefore, settle that point, and show that we are\nneither afraid of him nor prepared to be made dupes of.\nThe Queen is desirous that no official person should treat the Duke\nwith a distinction which is likely to attract unnecessary attention.\nBelieve me, always yours truly,\nALBERT.",

In consequence of\nthis information, it was thought to be dangerous for the Prince to\nwalk or to expose himself in the neighbourhood of Holyrood House. He\nwas frequently driven in a carriage to Lord Morton's, where he\nremained for a few hours, taking exercise in the park, and playing\nwith Lord Morton's children. It is the recollection of this which has\nled the Prince to make his acknowledgments on the present occasion.\nLord Aberdeen also begs humbly to mention to your Majesty that on his\narrival here he found the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch in expectation\nof a visit from the Duc de Bordeaux, on his way from Glasgow\nto Carlisle. Lord Aberdeen informed the Duke and Duchess of the\nobjections which might exist to this visit; but he believes that\ncommunications on the subject had already gone too far to render\nit possible to break it off with any degree of propriety. The great\nattentions paid by the Duke and his predecessors to the French Royal\nFamily, both during the former and last emigration, sufficient account\nfor this desire on the part of the Prince.",

Forgive me, dearest Uncle, if I say that I am\nglad that you are _at length_ going back to Belgium, as (though I\nfully understand from _personal_ experience how delightful it must be\nto be in the midst of that dear and perfect family) I think these long\nabsences distress your faithful Belgians a little.\nWe returned on Saturday, highly pleased and interested with our\ntour, though a little _done up_. I seldom remember more enthusiasm\nthan was shown at Cambridge, and in particular by the Undergraduates.\nThey received my dear Angel, too, with the greatest enthusiasm. This\nis useful, as these young people _will all, in time_, have a certain\npart to play; they are the rising generation, and an event of this\nkind makes a lasting impression on their minds.\nYou will have heard from Louise that there is no longer any impediment\nto the dear Nemours coming, which you may easily conceive gives me the\ngreatest satisfaction. Since then, I have heard that Bordeaux does not\nintend visiting London till he sees by the papers that the Nemours are\ngone. I saw a letter from a gentleman, with whom he had been staying,\nand who says that he is very pleasing and unaffected, and very easily\namused, and quite pleased \"with missing a few pheasants, and dancing\nquadrilles in the evening to a pianoforte.\" Poor fellow! his fate\ncertainly is a melancholy one. He should renounce, buy some property\nin Germany, and marry, and settle there.\nI am glad to hear of Montpensier's arrival, and that my favourite\nChica is in your good graces; she is a dear natural child. I am so\nimpatient to see my dear Victoire and good Nemours--who was always a\ngreat ally of mine--again!\nThe Grand Duke came here last night, and goes away after luncheon, and\nleaves England on Thursday. He is charmed with all he has seen, and I\nmust say is very amiable and civil. He has got a most charming large\ndog, called Dragon, like a Newfoundland, only brown and white, with\nthe most expressive eyes imaginable and _si bien dress\u00e9_. Prince\nAlexander of the Netherlands is also coming down to take leave this\nweek. We never had so many visitors.\nI am beyond everything interested with that beautiful novel by\nRellstab, _1812_, which I know you admire so much. The description\nof the Russian Campaign is incomparable, and so beautifully written.\nYou quite _see_ everything before you. Have you read his other, _Paris\nund Algier_? By the by, have you read Custine's book on Russia?\nThey say it is very severe on Russia, and full of hatred to the\nEnglish.\nWe found the children very well, and Bertie quite recovered, but poor\nfat Alice (who, I _must_ say, is becoming _very_ pretty) has had the\nearache.\nMamma with Feo and Ernest are with the Queen Dowager at Witley Court\nsince Thursday last, and only return next Thursday (the day after\nto-morrow). Clem seems very happy, and writes that she is happiest\nwhen she is _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ with poor Gusti, which _I_ should _not_\nfancy. Ever, dearest Uncle, your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.\nI open my letter, dearest Uncle, to say that I have _just_ seen in a\nconfidential despatch from Lord Cowley that Aumale is authorised\nto ask for the hand of the daughter of the Prince de Salerno (a\nsingular coincidence after what I wrote to you in _utter ignorance_\nof this report), and that he was also to find out what the opinions of\nthe Neapolitan Royal Family were respecting an alliance with the Queen\nof Spain. But tell me, dearest Uncle, if these reports are true? You\nmay _rely_ on my discretion, and I shall not breathe a word of what\nyou may answer me, if you wish the secret to be kept.",

The confidence you show me I feel deeply and\ngratefully, and you may rely on my discretion. Before I touch upon any\nof the subjects in your letter I will give you news of our visitors.\nThe dear Nemours arrived safely after a good passage on Saturday, well\nbut very tired. They are now quite recovered, and we are too happy to\nhave them here. Nemours looks well, and is very kind and amiable, but\nI think there is a seriousness since poor Chartres' death which used\nnot to be formerly, though he always was _reserved_, and that, I\nthink, he is _not_ now. Dearest Victoire is _amazingly_ improved and\n_d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e_--really quite wonderfully so. We are all so struck by it,\nby her good sense and by her conversation; and with that she has\nkept that innocence and gentleness which she always had--and is _so\nlovely_, dear sweet child. I must always look at her, and she, dear\nchild, seems so pleased to see me again. I find her _grown_, but grown\nvery thin, and she has not those bright colours she used to have. All\nthat you say of Bordeaux is just what Nemours says, and what Guizot\nwrites, and what _I_ and also Sir Robert Peel _always_ felt and\nthought. Aberdeen, with the greatest wish to do _all_ that is kind and\nright, _really thought_ that B. was only come to amuse himself,\nand had no idea till _now_ that the feeling in France in _all_ the\ndifferent parties was so strong. You will have heard by this time that\nwe have decided _not_ to receive B. in _any way_ whatever. It is a\npleasure to hear how mildly and sensibly Nemours speaks upon all these\nsubjects, and indeed every subject....\nI think you did _uncommonly right_ in what you answered the poor King\nabout the _arr\u00eat\u00e9_ in favour of the _Prussians_, and I am very glad\nyou _have_ done so. It will have a good effect here.\nLouise will tell you how we celebrated good Bertie's birthday. The\nchildren are in great favour with the Nemours.\nPray, dearest Uncle, do not forget to send me the list of Rellstab's\nworks. We think of making another little tour after the dear Nemours'\ndeparture, to Drayton (Sir Robert Peel's), Chatsworth, and Belvoir.\nWe are very sorry to lose dear Feo and Ernest.

It seems probable that in consequence of what the Duc\nde L\u00e9vis may have heard, as well as from the course pursued by the\nfriends of the Duc de Bordeaux, Lord Aberdeen may not now see him\nat all. Should this be the case, Lord Aberdeen is rather inclined\nto regret it; as although he would formerly have seen him with some\nreluctance, he would now be glad to have an opportunity of expressing\nhis sentiments very plainly respecting the proceedings of the Prince\nand his adherents in this country.\nLord Aberdeen understands from Sir Robert Peel that your Majesty would\nlike to be informed of any particulars connected with the Lev\u00e9e lately\nheld by the Duc de Bordeaux. Lord Aberdeen would willingly communicate\nthese particulars, but in reality there is very little to be added\nto the official accounts contained in the _Morning Post_, which it\nis obvious are inserted by authority. He saw M. de Ste Aulaire this\nmorning, who was a good deal excited by what has taken place, and has\nwritten very fully to Paris; but he knew nothing more than he had seen\nin the newspapers.\nIt may perhaps be worth mentioning to your Majesty that at the\npresentation of the Address by M. Chateaubriand on Friday, the\ncries of \"Vive le Roi!\" and \"Vive Henri V.!\" were so loud as to be\ndistinctly audible in the Square. Lord Aberdeen understands that this\nenthusiasm has been the cause of serious differences amongst many of\nthose who had come to pay their respects to the Duc de Bordeaux, a\nlarge portion of whom are by no means disposed to recognise him as\nKing during the life of the Duc d'Angoul\u00eame.\nLord Aberdeen cannot learn that any other member of the Diplomatic\nBody has been presented to the Duc de Bordeaux, and does not believe\nthat any such presentation has taken place. Indeed, there appears to\nbe a general disinclination that such should be the case; although\nsome of them feel considerable difficulty in consequence of the\nrelationship existing between their Sovereigns and the Prince.",

The grounds, with all the woods and cascades\nand fountains, are so beautiful too. The first evening there was a\nball, and the next the cascades and fountains were illuminated, which\nhad a beautiful effect. There was a large party there, including\nmany of the Duke's family, the Bedfords, Buccleuchs, the Duke of\nWellington, the Normanbys, Lord Melbourne (who is much better),\nand the Beauvales. We arrived here at half-past two, we perform our\njourney so delightfully on the railroad, so quickly and easily. It\nputs me in mind of our dear stay in Belgium, when we stop at the\nvarious stations.\nAlbert is going out hunting to-morrow, which I wish was _over_, but I\nam assured that the country is much better than the Windsor country.\nThe Duc de Bordeaux's proceedings in London are most highly improper.\nThe Queen Dowager is also here.\nWe leave this place on Thursday for home, which, I own, I shall be\nglad of at last.

Our promised visit,\nour dearest Papa's, and our fondest wish, all is put an end to. The\nviolence of our grief may be over, but the desolate feeling which\nsucceeds it is worse, and tears are a relief. I have never known real\n_grief_ till now, and it has made a lasting impression on me. A father\nis _such_ a _near_ relation, you are a _piece_ of him in fact,--and\nall (as my poor _deeply afflicted_ Angel says) the earliest pleasures\nof your life were given you by a dear father; that can _never be\nreplaced_ though time may soften the pang. And indeed one loves to\n_cling_ to one's grief; I can understand Louise's feeling in her\noverwhelming sorrows.\nLet me now join my humble entreaties to Albert's, relative to the\nrequest about dearest Louise, which he has made. It is a sacrifice\nI ask, but if you _knew_ the sacrifice I make in letting and urging\nAlbert _to go_, I am sure, if you _can_ you _will_ grant it. I have\n_never_ been separated from him even for _one night_, and the _thought\nof such_ a separation is quite dreadful; still, I feel I _could_ bear\nit,--I have made up my mind to it, as the very _thought_ of going has\nbeen a comfort to my poor Angel, and will be of such use at Coburg.\nStill, if I were to remain _quite_ alone I do not think I _could_ bear\nit quietly. Therefore _pray_ do send me my dearly beloved Louise; she\nwould be _such_ a comfort to me; if you could come too--or afterwards\n(as you promised us a longer visit), that would be still more\ndelightful. I may be indiscreet, but you must think of _what_ the\nseparation from my _all and all_, even only for a _fortnight_, will be\nto me!\nWe feel some _years_ older since these days of mourning. Mamma is\ncalm, but poor Aunt Julia is indeed much to be pitied. Ever,\ndearest Uncle, your devoted and unhappy Niece and Child,\nVICTORIA R.",

I have ever had the care and affection of a _real father_ for\nyou, and it has perhaps even been freer from many drawbacks which\noccasionally will exist betwixt parents and children, be they ever\nso well and affectionately together. With me, even from the moment in\nJanuary 1820, when I was called by a messenger to Sidmouth, my care\nfor you has been unremitting, and never has there been a cloud between\nus.... A thing which often strikes me, in a very satisfactory manner,\nis that we never had any bitter words, a thing which happens even with\npeople who are very lovingly together; and the little row which we\nhad in 1838 you remember well, and do not now think that _I_\nwas wrong. _De pareilles relations sont rares; may they ever\ncontinue!_\nI cannot leave this more serious topic without adding that though you\nwere always warm-hearted and right-minded, it must strike yourself how\nmatured every kind and good feeling is in your generous heart. _The\nheart, and not the head, is the safest guide in positions like yours_,\nand this not only for this earthly and very short life, but for that\nwhich we must hope for hereafter. When a life draws nearer its close,\nhow many earthly concerns are there that appear _still in the same\nlight_? and how clearly the mind is struck that nothing has been and\nis still of _real_ value, than the nobler and better feelings of the\nheart; the only good we can hope to keep as a precious store for the\nfuture. What do we keep of youth, beauty, richness, power, and even\nthe greatest extent of earthly possessions? NOTHING! ... Your truly\ndevoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

A great\nevent and a great compliment _his_ visit certainly is, and the\npeople _here_ are extremely flattered at it. He is certainly a _very\nstriking_ man; still very handsome; his profile is _beautiful_, and\nhis manners _most_ dignified and graceful; extremely civil--quite\nalarmingly so, as he is so full of attentions and _politesses_. But\nthe expression of the _eyes_ is _formidable_, and unlike anything I\never saw before. He gives me and Albert the impression of a man who is\n_not_ happy, and on whom the weight of his immense power and position\nweighs heavily and painfully; he seldom smiles, and when he does\nthe expression is _not_ a happy one. He is very easy to get on with.\nReally, it seems like a dream when I think that we breakfast and walk\nout with _this_ greatest of all earthly Potentates as quietly as if we\nwalked, etc., with Charles or any one. We took him, with the dear good\nKing of Saxony, who is a great contrast to the _Czar_ (and with\nwhom I am _quite_ at my ease), to Adelaide Cottage after breakfast.\nThe grass here is just as if it had been burned with fire. _How_ many\ndifferent Princes have we not gone the same round with!! The children\nare much admired by the _Sovereigns_--(how _grand_ this sounds!)--and\nAlice allowed the Emperor to take her in his arms, and kissed him _de\nson propre accord_. We are always so thankful that they are _not_ shy.\nBoth the Emperor and the King are _quite_ enchanted with Windsor. The\nEmperor said very _poliment_: \"C'est digne de vous, Madame.\" I must\nsay the Waterloo Room lit up with that entire service of gold looks\nsplendid; and the Reception Room, beautiful to sit in afterwards. The\nEmperor praised _my_ Angel very much, saying: \"C'est impossible de\nvoir un plus joli gar\u00e7on; il a l'air si noble et si bon\"; which I must\nsay _is very_ true. The Emperor amused the King and me by saying he\nwas so _embarrass\u00e9_ when people were presented to him, and that\nhe felt so \"_gauche_\" _en frac_, which certainly he is quite\n_unaccustomed_ to wear. If we can do anything to get him to do what is\nright by you, we shall be most happy, and Peel and Aberdeen are very\nanxious for it. I believe he leaves on Sunday again. To-morrow there\nis to be a great review, and on Thursday _I_ shall probably go with\nthem to the races; _they_ are gone there with Albert to-day, but I\nhave remained at home.\nI think it is time to conclude my long letter.\nIf the French are angry at this visit, let their dear King and their\nPrinces come; _they_ will be sure of a _truly affectionate_ reception\non our part. The one which Emperor Nicholas has received is cordial\nand civil, _mais ne vient pas du c[oe]ur_.\nI humbly beg that any remarks which may _not_ be favourable to our\ngreat visitor may _not_ go _beyond_ you and Louise, and _not_ to\n_Paris_.

    "body": "MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I received your very kind and long letter of the\n7th on Sunday, and thank you very much for it. I am delighted that\nmy accounts interested you, and I shall try and give you some more\nto-day, which you will see come from an unbiassed and impartial mind,\nand which I trust therefore _will_ be relied upon. The excitement has\nceased as suddenly as it had begun, and I am still confused about it.\nI will go back to where I last left you. The _Revue_ on the 5th\nwas really very interesting, and our reception as well as that of the\nEmperor _most_ enthusiastic. Louise tells me you had a review the\nsame day, and that it also was so hot. Our children were there,\nand charmed. On the 6th we went with the Emperor and King to the\nraces, and I never saw such a crowd; again _here_ the reception\nwas _most brilliant_. Every evening a large dinner in the Waterloo\nRoom, and the two last evenings in uniforms, as the Emperor disliked\nso being _en frac_, and was quite embarrassed in it. On the 7th we\ntook him and the King back here, and in the evening had a party of 260\nabout. On Saturday (8th) my Angel took the Emperor and King to a very\nelegant breakfast at Chiswick, which I for prudence' sake did\n_not_ go to, but was very sorry for it. In the evening we went to\nthe Opera (_not_ in State), but they recognised us, and we were most\nbrilliantly received. I had to force the Emperor forward, as he never\nwould come forward when I was there, and I was obliged to take him by\nthe hand and make him appear; it was impossible to be better bred or\nmore respectful than he was towards me. Well, on Sunday afternoon at\nfive, he left us (my Angel accompanied him to Woolwich), and he\nwas much affected at going, and really unaffectedly touched at his\nreception and stay, the simplicity and quietness of which told upon\nhis love of domestic life, which is very great. I will now (having\ntold _all_ that has passed) give you _my_ opinion and feelings on the\nsubject, which I may say are Albert's also. I was extremely against\nthe visit, fearing the _g\u00eane_, and bustle, and even at first, I did\nnot feel at _all_ to like it, but by living in the same house together\nquietly and unrestrainedly (and this Albert, and with great truth,\nsays is the great advantage of these visits, that I not only _see_\nthese great people but _know_ them), I got to know the Emperor and he\nto know me. There is much about him which I cannot help liking, and\nI think his character is _one_ which should be understood, and\nlooked upon for _once_ as it is. He is stern and severe--with fixed\nprinciples of _duty_ which _nothing_ on earth will make him change;\nvery _clever_ I do _not_ think him, and his mind is an uncivilised\none; his education has been neglected; politics and military concerns\nare the only things he takes great interest in; the arts and all\nsofter occupations he is insensible to, but he is sincere, I am\ncertain, _sincere_ even in his most despotic acts, from a sense that\nthat _is_ the _only_ way to govern; he is not, I am sure, aware of the\ndreadful cases of individual misery which he so often causes, for I\ncan see by various instances that he is kept in utter ignorance of\n_many_ things, which his people carry out in most corrupt ways, while\nhe thinks that he is extremely just. He thinks of general measures,\nbut does not look into detail. And I am sure _much_ never reaches\nhis ears, and (as you observed), how can it? He asked for _nothing_\nwhatever, has merely expressed his great anxiety to be upon the best\nterms with us, but _not_ to the _exclusion of others_, only let things\nremain as they are.... He is I should say, too frank, for he talks\nso openly before people, which he should not do, and with difficulty\nrestrains himself. His anxiety _to be believed_ is _very_ great, and\nI must say his personal promises I _am inclined_ to believe; then his\nfeelings are very strong; he _feels_ kindness deeply--and his love for\nhis wife and children, and for all children, is _very_ great. He has a\nstrong feeling for domestic life, saying to me, when our children were\nin the room: \"Voil\u00e0 les doux moments de notre vie.\" He was not only\ncivil, but extremely kind _to us both_, and spoke in the highest\npraise of dearest Albert to Sir Robert Peel, saying he wished any\nPrince in Germany had that ability and sense; he showed Albert great\nconfidence, and I _think_ it will do great good, as if _he_ praises\nhim abroad it will have great weight. He is _not_ happy, and that\nmelancholy which is visible in the countenance made me sad at times;\nthe sternness of the eyes goes very much off when you know him,\nand changes according to his being put out (and he _can_ be much\nembarrassed) or not, and also from his being heated, as he suffers\nwith congestions to the head. My Angel thinks that he is a man\ninclined too much to give way to impulse and feeling, which makes him\nact wrongly often. His admiration for beauty is very great, and put me\nmuch in mind of you, when he drove out with us, looking out for\npretty people. But he remains very faithful to those he admired\n_twenty-eight_ years ago; for instance, Lady Peel, who has hardly\nany remains left. Respecting Belgium he did not speak to _me_, but to\nAlbert and the Ministers. As for unkindly feeling towards _you_, he\ndisclaims positively any, saying he knew you well, and that you had\nserved in the Russian Army, etc., but he says those _unfortunate_\nPoles are the _only_ obstacle, and that he positively cannot\nenter into direct communication _with Belgium_ as long as they are\n_employed_. If you could only somehow or other get rid of them, I am\nsure the thing would be done at once. We all think he _need_ not\nmind this, but I fear he has pledged himself. He admired Charlotte's\npicture. _Pour finir_, I must say one more word or two about his\npersonal appearance. He puts us much in mind of his and our cousins\nthe W\u00fcrtembergs, and has altogether much of the W\u00fcrtemberg family\nabout him. He is bald now, but in his Chevalier Garde Uniform he is\n_magnificent_ still, and very _striking_. I cannot deny that we were\nin great anxiety when we took him out lest some Pole might make an\nattempt, and I always felt thankful when we got him safe home again.\nHis poor daughter is very ill, I fear. The good King of Saxony\nremains another week with us, and we like him much. He is so\nunassuming. He is out sight-seeing _all_ day, and enchanted with\neverything. I hope that you will persuade the King to come all\nthe same in September. Our _motives_ and politics are _not_ to be\nexclusive, but to be on good terms with _all_, and why should we not?\nWe make no secret of it.\nNow I must end this very long letter. Ever your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.\nYou will kindly not _speak_ of these details, but only in _allgemein_\nsay the visit went off very satisfactorily on _both sides_, and that\nit was _highly pacific_.",

I can write to you with a light heart, thank goodness,\nto-day, for the Government obtained a majority, which _up_ to the\n_last_ moment last night we feared they would not have, and we have\nbeen in sad trouble for the last four or five days about it. It\nis the more marvellous, as, if the Government asked for a _Vote_\nof Confidence, they would have a _Majority_ of 100; but this very\nstrength makes the supporters of the Government act in a _most_\nunjustifiable manner by continually acting and voting against them,\n_not_ listening to the debates, but coming down and voting against the\nGovernment. So that we were really in the greatest _possible_ danger\nof having a resignation of the Government _without knowing to whom to\nturn_, and this from the recklessness of a handful of foolish _half_\n\"Puseyite\" half \"Young England\" people! I am sure you will agree\nwith me that Peel's resignation would not only be for us (for _we\ncannot_ have a better and a _safer_ Minister), but for the whole\ncountry, and for the peace of Europe--a _great calamity_. Our present\npeople are all _safe_, and not led away by impulses and reckless\npassions. We must, however, take care and not get into another crisis;\nfor I assure you we have been quite miserable and _quite_ alarmed ever\nsince Saturday.\nSince I last wrote to you, I spoke to Aberdeen (whom I should be\nequally sorry to lose, as he is so _very fair_, and has served _us\npersonally_, so kindly and truly), and he told me that the Emperor has\n_positively pledged_ himself to send a Minister to Brussels the moment\nthose Poles are no longer employed; that he is quite aware of\nthe importance of the measure, and would be disposed to make the\narrangement easy, and that he spoke very kindly of _you_ personally.\nAberdeen says it is not necessary to disgrace them in any way, but\nonly for the present _de les \u00e9loigner_. The Emperor has evidently some\ntime ago made some strong declaration on the subject which he feels\nhe cannot get over, and, as I said before, he will not give up what he\nhas once pledged his word to. _Then, no one_ on earth _can_ move him.\n_Au fond_, it is a fine _trait_, but he carries it too far. He wrote\nme a _very_ kind and affectionate letter from the Hague. The Emperor\nhas given Bertie the Grand Cross of St Andrew, which the boy was quite\nproud of.\nOur kind and good King of Saxony leaves us to-morrow, after having\nseen more than anybody has done almost, and having enjoyed it of all\nthings. He is quite at home with us and the children, whom he plays\nwith much. Alice walks quite alone, and looks too funny, as she is so\n_very_ fat. Now, ever your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

I am truly and sincerely happy that\na Ministerial crisis has been spared you; it is in all constitutional\nconcerns an _awful_ business; but in such a colossal machinery as the\nBritish Empire, it shakes the whole globe. For your sake, for the\ngood of England, and for the quiet of the whole earth, we must most\ndevoutly pray that _Sir Robert may remain for many, many years your\ntrusty and faithful Minister._ Parliaments and Chambers are\nextremely fond of governing, particularly as long as it does not bore\nthemselves. We have had an instance of it recently. I was anxious\nto keep the Chamber longer, as there are still many important things\nwhich it ought to have finished; but they were hot, they got tired,\nvoted twelve _projets de loi_ in one day, and disappeared afterwards,\nleaving one the trouble of managing the affairs of the State as best\none may....\nAs a general political event, the Emperor's visit in England can only\nbe useful; it is probable that he would _not_ have made the visit if\nanother had not been talked of. His policy is naturally to _separate_\nas much as possible the two great Western Powers; he is too weak to\nresist single-handed their dictates in the Oriental question; _but if\nthey act not in concert_, it is evident that _he is the master_; in\nall this he acts wisely and in conformity with the great interests\nof his Empire. England has greater interests at stake at the mercy of\nRussia than at that of France. With France the questions are\nsometimes questions of jealousy, but, on the other hand, a tolerable\nunderstanding keeps France quiet and secures the peace of Europe, much\nmore in the sense of the European policy of England than of that of\nFrance. The only consolation the French can find in it is that they\nare aware that _together_ with England they have a great position,\nbut they always lament that they can _get nothing by it_. A bad\nunderstanding with France opens not only the door to a European war,\nbut also to revolution; and that is perhaps the most serious and most\nawfully dangerous part of the business. England wants nothing from the\nEmperor than that he should leave the _status quo_ of Europe and\ngreat part of Asia alone. At Paris they are not so much moved at the\nEmperor's visit as perhaps they ought to be, but they have put the\nflattering notion into their heads that he had made _fiasco_, which is\n_not true_; as, in fact, he has so far been rather _successful_, and\nhas convinced people in England that he is a mild and good-natured\nman, himself and his Empire, without any ambition. Now it is high time\nI should finish my immense scrawl, for which I claim your forgiveness,\nremaining ever your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

My father is one of the\nbeings _most easy_ to _please_, _satisfy_, and to _accommodate_.\nHis eventful life has used him to everything, and makes any kind of\narrangements acceptable to him; there is only _one thing_ which\nhe _cannot easily do_, it is to be _ready very early_. He means\nnotwithstanding to try to come to your breakfast, but you _must insist\nupon his not doing it_. It would disturb him in all his habits, and be\nbad for him, as he would certainly eat, a thing he is not used to\ndo in the morning. He generally takes hardly what may be called a\n_breakfast_, and eats _only twice_ in the day. It would be also _much\nbetter_ for him if he only appeared to luncheon and dinner, and if you\nkindly dispensed him altogether of the breakfast. You must not tell\nhim that I wrote you _this_, but you must manage it with Montpensier,\nand kindly order for him a bowl of _chicken broth_. It is the only\nthing he takes generally in the morning, and between his meals. I\nhave also no observation to make, but I have told Montpensier to speak\nopenly to Albert whenever he thought something ought to be done for my\nfather, or might hurt and inconvenience him, and you may consult him\nwhen you are in doubt. He is entrusted with all the recommendations\nof my mother, for my father is naturally _so imprudent_ and _so little\naccustomed_ to _caution and care_, that he must in some measure be\n_watched_ to prevent his catching cold or doing what may be injurious\nto him. About his _rooms_, a hard bed and a large table for his papers\nare the only things he requires. He generally sleeps on a horse-hair\nmattress with a plank of wood under it: but _any kind_ of bed will do,\nif it is not _too soft_. His liking will be to be entirely at _your\ncommands_ and to do _all you like_. You know he can take a great deal\nof exercise, and _everything_ will _interest_ and _delight_ him, to\nsee, as to do: this is not a compliment, but a _mere fact_. His only\nwish is, that you should not go out of your way for him, and change\nyour habits on his account. Lord Aberdeen will be, of course, at\nWindsor, and I suppose you will ask, as you told me, the Royal Family.\nMy father hopes to see also Sir Robert Peel, Lord Stanley, and your\nother Ministers. You will probably ask most of them during his stay.\nHe wishes very much to see again those he already knows, and to make\nthe acquaintance of those he does not know yet. In writing all this\nI think I _dream_, I _cannot believe_ yet that in a few days my dear\nfather will have, God willing, the _unspeakable happiness_ to see you\nagain and at _Windsor_, a thing he had _so much wished_ for and which\nfor a _long time_ seemed so _improbable_. You have _no notion_ of the\n_satisfaction_ it gives him, and _how delighted_ he will be to see you\nagain, and to be once more in England. God grant he may have a good\npassage, and arrive to you _safely_ and _well_. _Unberufen_, as you\nwill soon, I trust, be able to see, he is, notwithstanding the usual\ntalk of the papers, _perfectly well_.... Yours most devotedly,\nLOUISE.",

He was\n_delighted_, and was _most_ enthusiastically and affectionately\nreceived wherever he showed himself. Our proceedings I wrote to good,\ndear Louise (whom you should not leave so long alone), who will no\ndoubt have given you the details. What an extraordinary man the King\nis! What a wonderful memory, and how lively, _how sagacious!_He spoke\nvery openly to us all, and is determined that our affairs should go on\nwell. He wishes Tahiti _au fond de la mer_. He spoke also very openly\nabout poor Hadjy's _brochure_ which seems to have distressed him more\nthan anything. The King praised my dearest Albert most highly, and\nfully appreciates his great qualities and talents--and what gratifies\nme _so much_, treats him completely as his equal, calling him \"Mon\nFr\u00e8re,\" and saying to me that _my husband_ was the same as me, which\nit is--and \"Le Prince Albert, c'est pour moi le Roi.\" The King is\n_very_ sad to go, but he is determined, he says, _to see me every\nyear_. Another _very_ great thing is, that the officers of the two\nNavies staying at Portsmouth were on the best terms together and\npaying one another every sort of compliment. As Admiral La Susse (a\nvery gentlemanlike man) and his squadron were sadly disappointed on\nMonday, we thought it would please them if we went on board the\n_Gomer_, which we did, on Tuesday morning, and breakfasted there, and\nI drank the King's health.

The\nliterature of the West is the most favourite study amongst the Hindoos\nin their schools and colleges. They will discuss with accuracy the\nmost important events in British History. Boys of fifteen years of\nage, black in colour, will recite the most favourite passages\nfrom Shakespeare, ably quoting the notes of the English and German\ncommentators.

The studies in the Mohammedan schools and colleges\nhave hitherto been confined to Arabic, the Koran, and abstruse studies\nrelating to their religion, having always shown a marked aversion to\nEnglish literature.

I\nneed not dwell on my sentiments of devotion to you; they began with\n_your life, and will only end with mine_. The only claim I make is to\nbe remembered with some little affection. Thank heaven, I have little\nto wish you, than that your present happiness may not be disturbed,\nand that those who are dear to you may be preserved for your\nhappiness.\nMy gift is Charlotte's portrait. The face is extremely like, and the\nlikest that exists; the hair is a little too fair, it had become\nalso darker. I take this opportunity to repeat that Charlotte was a\nnoble-minded and highly gifted creature. She was nervous, as all\nthe family have been; she could be violent, but then she was full\nof repentance for it, and her disposition _highly generous_ and\n_susceptible_ of _great devotion_.\nI am the more bound to say this, as I understood that you had some\nnotion that she had been _very imperious_, and not mistress of her\ntemper. Before her marriage some people by dint of flattery had tried\nto give her masculine tastes; and in short had pushed her to become\none day a sort of Queen Elizabeth. These sentiments were already\na little modified before her marriage. But she was particularly\ndetermined to be a _good_ and _obedient_ wife; some of her friends\nwere anxious she should _not_; amongst these Madame de Flahaut must be\nmentioned _en premi\u00e8re ligne_.\nThis became even a subject which severed the intimacy between them.\nMadame de Flahaut, much older than Charlotte, and of a sour and\ndetermined character, had gained an influence which partook on\nCharlotte's part a little of fear. She was afraid of her, but when\nonce supported took courage.\nPeople were much struck on the 2nd of May 1816 at Carlton House with\nthe clearness and firmness with which she pronounced \"_and obey_,\"\netc., as there had been a _general belief_ that it would be _for the\nhusband_ to give _these promises_. The Regent put me particularly on\nmy guard, and said, \"If you don't resist she will govern you with a\nhigh hand.\" Your own experience has convinced you that real affection\nchanges many sentiments that may have been implanted into the mind of\na young girl. With Charlotte it was the more meritorious, as from a\nvery early period of her life she was considered as the heiress of the\nCrown; the Whigs flattered her extremely, and later, when she got by\nmy intervention reconciled to the Tories, they also made great efforts\nto please her.\nHer understanding was extremely good; she knew everybody, and I even\nafterwards found her judgment generally extremely correct. _She had\nread a great deal and knew well what she had read._ Generous she was\nalmost _too much_, and her _devotion_ was quite affecting, from a\ncharacter so much pushed to be selfish and imperious.\nI will here end my souvenir of poor dear Charlotte, but I thought\nthat the subject could not but be interesting to you. Her constancy in\nwishing to marry me, which she maintained under difficulties of every\ndescription, has been the foundation of all that touched the family\nafterwards. You know, I believe, that your poor father was the chief\npromoter, though also the Yorks were; but our correspondence from 1814\ntill 1816 was entirely carried on through his kind intervention; it\nwould otherwise have been impossible, as she was really treated as a\nsort of prisoner. Grant always to that good and generous Charlotte,\nwho sleeps already with her beautiful little boy so long, where all\nwill go to, an affectionate remembrance, and believe me she deserves\nit.\nForgive my long letter, and see in it, what it really is, a token of\nthe great affection I have for you. Ever, my dearest Victoria, your\ndevoted Uncle.\nLEOPOLD R.",

We passing down the Channel\nduring the night, and as the weather was perfectly bright and fine,\nfound ourselves off Tr\u00e9port before nine o'clock this morning. The King\ncame off to the yacht, and took the Queen in his barge to land. I need\nnot say how joyfully she was received by all the Royal Family.\nAlthough I shall have opportunities, both this evening and to-morrow\nmorning, of speaking again with the King and Guizot, I have already\ndiscussed several subjects with each of them; and as the Queen\nparticularly desires to send a messenger this evening, I will give you\nsome notion of what has passed between us.\nI think the marriage of the Queen of Spain is the subject on which the\ngreatest interest is felt at this moment. It was the first introduced,\nboth by the King and Guizot, and treated by both in the same manner.\nThey said, that having promised to support the King of Naples, they\nwere bound not to abandon the Count de Trapani, so long as there was a\nchance of his being successful in his suit. I said in answer to\ntheir desire, that we would assist this arrangement, that we had no\nobjection to Count Trapani, and that we would take no part against\nhim; but unless it should be the decided wish of the Spanish\nGovernment and people, we could give no support to the marriage, as we\nwere honestly of opinion that it was not desired in Spain, and that\nwe saw nothing in the proposal to call for our support under these\ncircumstances. Both the King and Guizot said they had no objection to\nthe Duke of Saville (Don Enrique), and that if it should be found\nthat Count Trapani was impossible, they would willingly support him.\nWith respect to the Infanta, they both declared in the most positive\nand explicit manner, that _until the Queen was married and had\nchildren_, they should consider the Infanta precisely as her sister,\nand that any marriage with a French Prince would be entirely out of\nthe question. The King said he did not wish that his son should have\nthe prospect of being on the throne of Spain; but that if the Queen\nhad children, by whom the succession would be secured, he did not\nengage to preclude himself from the possibility of profiting by the\ngreat inheritance which the Infanta would bring his son. All this,\nhowever, was uncertain, and would require time at all events to\naccomplish; for I distinctly understood, that it was not only a\nmarriage and a child, but _children, that were necessary to secure the\nsuccession_.\nI thought this was as much as we could desire at present, and that the\npolicy of a marriage with a French Prince might safely be left to be\nconsidered whenever the contingency contemplated should arrive. Many\nthings may happen, both in France and Spain, in the course of a few\nyears to affect this question in a manner not now apparent.\nABERDEEN.",

    "body": "On receiving the preceding letter ... we were, of course, in great\nconsternation. Yesterday Sir Robert Peel arrived here and explained\nthe condition of affairs.\nOn 1st November he had called his Cabinet, and placed before its\nmembers the reports of the Irish Commissioners, Dr Buckland, Dr\nPlayfair and Dr Lindley, on the condition of the potato crop, which\nwas to the effect that the half of the potatoes were ruined by the\nrot, and that no one could guarantee the remainder. Belgium, Holland,\nSweden, and Denmark, in which states the potato disease had likewise\ndeprived the poorer class of its usual food, have immediately taken\nenergetic means, and have opened the harbours, bought corn, and\nprovided for the case of a rise of prices. Sir Robert proposed the\nsame thing for England, and, by opening the ports, a preparation for\nthe abolition of the Corn Laws. His colleagues refused, and of the\nwhole Cabinet only Lord Aberdeen, Sir James Graham, and Mr Sidney\nHerbert voted with him. Sir Robert hoped that in time the opinions of\nthe others would change, and therefore postponed a final decision.\nIn the meanwhile the agitation of the Anti-Corn Law League began;\nin every town addresses were voted, meetings were held, the\n_Times_--barometer of public feeling--became suddenly _violently_\nAnti-Corn Law, the meetings of the Cabinet roused attention, a general\npanic seized on the mass of the public. Sir Robert called anew his\nCabinet. In the midst of their deliberation Lord John Russell issues\nfrom Edinburgh an address to the City of London.\nThe whole country cries out: the Corn Laws are doomed.\nThereon Sir Robert declared to his Cabinet that nothing but unanimity\ncould save the cause, and pressed for a decision.\nThe Duke of Buccleuch and Lord Stanley declared they could not take a\npart in a measure abolishing the Corn Laws, and would therefore have\nto resign. The other members, including the Duke of Wellington, showed\nthemselves ready to support Sir Robert, yet, as the latter says,\n\"apparently not willingly and against their feelings.\" Thereupon Sir\nRobert resolved to lay down his office as Minister.\nWhen he arrived here he was visibly much moved, and said to me, that\nit was one of the most painful moments of his life to separate himself\nfrom us, \"but it is necessary, and if I have erred it was from loyalty\nand too great an anxiety not to leave Her Majesty in a moment of such\ngreat difficulty. I ought to have gone when I was first left by my\ncolleagues in a minority in my own Cabinet. I was anxious, however, to\ntry my utmost, but it is impossible to retrieve lost time. As soon as\nI saw Lord John's letter I felt that the ground was slipping away\nfrom under me, and that whatever I might now propose would appear as\ndictated by the Opposition, as taking Lord John's measure. On the 1st\nof November the whole country was prepared for the thing; there had\nbeen no agitation, everybody looking to the Government, as soon as\nthey saw this wavering and hesitating, the country decided for itself,\nand Lord John has the merit, owing to his most dexterous move and our\nwant of unanimity.\"\nOn my observing that Sir Robert has a majority of one hundred in the\nHouse of Commons, and asking whether it was not possible for him to\ncontinue the Government, he said:--\n\"The Duke of Buccleuch will carry half Scotland with him, and Lord\nStanley, leading the Protectionists in the House of Lords, would lead\nto great and immediate defections even in Her Majesty's household. The\nDuchess of Buccleuch, Lord Hardwicke, Lord Exeter, Lord Rivers,\nLord Beverley, etc., would resign, and we should not be able to find\nsuccessors; in the House of Commons I am sure I should be beat, the\nTories, agriculturists, etc., in rage would turn round upon me and\nbe joined by the Whigs and Radicals, who would say, 'This is _our_\nmeasure and we will not allow you to carry it.' It is better that\nI should go now, when _nobody has committed himself_ in the heat\nof party contest, when no factions have been formed, no imprudent\ndeclarations been made; it is better for Her Majesty and for the\ncountry that it should be so.\"\nAfter we had examined what possibilities were open for the Crown, the\nconclusion was come to that Lord John was the only man who could be\ncharged with forming a Cabinet. Lord Stanley, with the aristocracy as\nhis base, would bring about an insurrection [or riots], and the ground\non which one would have to fight would be this: to want to force the\nmass of the people, amidst their great poverty, to pay for their bread\na high price, in favour of the landlords.\nIt is a matter of the utmost importance not to place the House of\nLords into direct antagonism with the Commons and with the masses of\nthe people. Sir Robert says very correctly:--\n\"I am afraid of other interests getting damaged in the struggle about\nthe Corn Laws; already the system of promotion in the Army, the Game\nLaws, the Church, are getting attacked with the aid of the league.\"\nAfter Victoria had in consequence [of the foregoing] decided in favour\nof Lord John, and asked Sir Robert: \"But how is it possible for him\nto govern with so exceedingly small a minority?\" Sir Robert said: \"He\nwill have difficulties and perhaps did not consider what he was doing\nwhen he wrote that letter; but _I will support him_. I feel it my duty\nto your Majesty not to leave you without a Government. Even if Lord\nJohn goes to the full extent of his declaration in that letter (which\nI think goes too far), I will support him in Parliament and use all\nmy influence with the House of Lords to prevent their impeding his\nprogress. I will do more, if he likes it. I will say that the increase\nof the estimates which will become necessary are my work, and I alone\nam responsible for it.\"\nSir Robert intends to give me a memorandum in which he is to make this\npromise in writing.\nHe was greatly moved, and said it was not \"the loss of power (for I\nhate power) nor of office,\" which was nothing but a plague for him,\nbut \"the breaking up of those relations in which he stood to the Queen\nand me, and the loss of our society,\" which was for him a loss, for\nwhich there was no equivalent; we might, however, rely on his being\nalways ready to serve us, in what manner and in what place it might\nbe. Lord Aberdeen is said to feel the same, and very deeply so; and on\nour side the loss of two so estimable men, who possess our whole and\nperfect confidence in public as well as in private affairs, and have\nalways proved themselves true friends, leaves _a great gap_.\nALBERT.",

    "body": "(_12 o'clock._)\nWe just saw Lord John Russell, who came in order to explain why he had\nto give up the task of forming a Government. He had written to all his\nformer colleagues to join him in his attempt, amongst others to Lord\nGrey, who answered, \"that he could only belong to a Government which\npledged itself to the principle of absolute free trade and abolition\nof all protection; that he had his own views upon the sugar question\n(as to which he advocated the admission of slave labour) and upon\nthe Irish question (as to which his principle was to establish entire\nreligious equality); that he hoped that in the formation of a new\nGovernment no personal considerations should stand in the way of a\nfull attention to public Duty.\"\nLord John replied that he advocated free trade, but as the immediate\nquestion before them was the _Corn Laws_, he thought it wiser not to\ncomplicate this by other declarations which would produce a good deal\nof animosity; that the sugar question and Ireland might be discussed\nin Cabinet when circumstances required it; that he agreed entirely in\nthe last sentence.\nAfter this Lord Grey declared himself quite satisfied. Lord John\nconsidered now with his colleagues the peculiar measure to be\nproposed, and Mr Baring thought he could arrange a financial scheme\nwhich would satisfy Lord Lansdowne's demands for relief to the landed\ninterest. They all felt it their duty to answer the Queen's call upon\nthem, though they very much disliked taking office under such peculiar\ndifficulties. Now Lord John undertook to apportion the different\noffices. He saw Lord Palmerston, and told him that the Queen had some\napprehension that his return to the Foreign Office might cause great\nalarm in other countries, and particularly in France, and that this\nfeeling was still more strongly manifested in the city; whether under\nthese circumstances he would prefer some other office--for instance,\nthe Colonies? Lord Palmerston declared that he was not at all anxious\nfor office, and should much regret that his accession should in any\nway embarrass Lord John; that he was quite prepared to support him out\nof office, but that his taking another department than his former one\nwould be a public recognition of the most unjust accusations that\nhad been brought against him; that he had evinced throughout a long\nofficial life his disposition for peace, and only in one instance\nbroke with France; that that matter was gone by, and that nobody\nhad stronger conviction of the necessity to keep in amity with that\nPower than himself. Upon this Lord John said that he could not form a\nGovernment without him, and showed himself quite satisfied with Lord\nPalmerston's declaration.\nSuddenly Lord Grey, who had heard of this, cried out: \"This was an\ninfringement of their compact\"; that no _personal_ consideration\nshould interfere with the discharge of public duty, and that he must\ndecline entering the Government, as he considered Lord Palmerston's\nreturn to the Foreign Office as fraught with danger to the peace\nof Europe. Lord John could not, under these circumstances, form a\nGovernment. He read to us a long letter from Lord Grey, written with\nthe intention that it should be seen by the Queen, in which Lord\nGrey enters more fully into his motives, and finishes by saying\nthat therefore _he_ was not answerable for the failure to form an\nAdministration.\nLord John gave the Queen a written statement of the causes which\ninduced him to relinquish the Government, and of the position he means\nto assume in Parliament. (He is most anxious that Sir R. Peel should\nre-enter and successfully carry his measures.)\nThe arrangements Lord John had contemplated have been--\nLord PALMERSTON,      _Foreign Secretary_.\n  Lord GREY,            _Colonial Secretary_.\n  Sir GEORGE GREY,      _Home Secretary_.\n(Sir George was anxious later to retire from Parliament, and willing\nto go as Governor-General to Canada.)\nMr BARING,            _Chancellor of the Exchequer_.\n  Lord CLARENDON,       _President of the Board of Trade_.\n(The Vice-Presidency was to have been offered to his brother, Mr\nVilliers, but finally, by his advice, to Mr Cobden!! (Lord Grey wanted\nMr Cobden to be in the Cabinet!!!) This Lord John thought quite out of\nthe question.)\nLord LANSDOWNE,       _President of the Council_.",

He\nwould have supported Lord John in _any_ measure which he should have\nthought fit to introduce, and many would have followed his example. He\nblamed the want of deference shown to the Queen, by not answering\nher call with more readiness; he said it was quite new and\nunconstitutional for a man to take a week before he undertook to form\na Government, and to pass that time in discussion with other people,\nto whom the Sovereign had not yet committed the task; and he had been\ncertain it would end so, when so many people were consulted. He in\n1834 had been called from Italy, had travelled with all haste and\nhad gone straight to the King, had told him that he had seen nobody,\nconsulted nobody, but immediately kissed the King's hand as his\nMinister.\nHe was now prepared to stand by the Queen, all other considerations\nhe had thrown aside, he would undertake to deal with the difficulties,\nand should have to go down alone to the House of Commons. He had\nwritten to his colleagues that he would serve the Queen if she called\nupon him to do so, that he expected them to meet him at nine o'clock\nthat evening, and that he would tell them what he meant to do. Those\nwho would not go with him, he would dismiss at once. He did not wish\nto avail himself of any undue advantage, and therefore would not\nadvise an Order in Council, but go at once to Parliament, laying his\nmeasure before it: \"Reject it, if you please; there it is!\"\nHe called the crisis an alarming one, which determination alone could\novercome.\nWe showed him Lord John Russell's statement, with which he declared\nhimself very much satisfied. He advised the Queen to write a letter\nto Lord John, announcing to him Sir Robert's consent to go on with the\nGovernment, and wrote a draft of it, which follows here.\nHe had heard strange instances of disagreement amongst the men whom\nLord John had assembled in town.\nSir Robert seemed throughout much moved, and said with much warmth:\n\"There is no sacrifice that I will not make for your Majesty, except\nthat of my honour.\"",

    "body": "We had a Council yesterday, at which Parliament was prorogued to\nthe 22nd of January, then to meet for the despatch of business. Lord\nStanley had an audience of the Queen before, and delivered up the\nSeals of his office. He was much agitated, and had told Sir Robert\nthat he dreaded this interview very much. The Queen thanked him for\nhis services, and begged he would do his best out of office to smooth\ndown the difficulties her Government would have to contend with. At\nthe Council Lord Dalhousie took his seat, and Mr Gladstone received\nthe Colonial Seals. The Queen saw the Duke of Buccleuch and\nthanked him for the devotion he had shown her during these trying\ncircumstances; the same to the Duke of Wellington, who is in excellent\nspirits. On my saying, \"You have such an influence over the House\nof Lords, that you will be able to keep them straight,\" he answered:\n\"I'll do anything; I am now beginning to write to them and to convince\nthem singly of what their duty is.\"\nWe saw afterwards Sir Robert Peel, who stayed more than three hours.\nHe is in the highest spirits at having got Mr Gladstone and kept the\nDuke of Buccleuch; he proposed that the Duke should be made President,\nand Lord Haddington Privy Seal in his stead. (Lord Haddington had\nbehaved very well, had given up his place to Sir Robert, and told him\nhe should do with him just as he liked--leave him out of the Cabinet,\nshift him to another place, or leave him at the Admiralty, as would\nsuit him best.)\nSir Robert hinted to Lord Ripon that Lord Haddington had behaved so\nwell, but got no more out of him, but \"that he would _almost_ have\ndone the same.\" Sir Robert proposes to see Lord Ellenborough in order\nto offer him the Admiralty, received the Queen's sanction likewise to\nLord St Germans (the Postmaster-General) being put into the Cabinet. I\nsaid: \"With your Government that has no inconvenience, and even if you\nhad a hundred members in the Cabinet, as you don't tell them but\nwhat is absolutely necessary, and follow your own course.\" He said in\nreply, that he should be very sorry if he had to have told his\nCabinet that he meant to send for Lord Ellenborough. We could not help\ncontrasting this conduct with the subjection Lord John has shown to\nhis people. It is to his _own_ talent and firmness that Sir Robert\nwill owe his success, which cannot fail. He said he had been\ndetermined not to go to a general election with the fetters the last\nelection had imposed upon him, and he had meant at the end of the next\nSession to call the whole Conservative Party together and to declare\nthis to them, that he would not meet another Parliament pledged to the\nmaintenance of the Corn Laws, which could be maintained no longer, and\nthat he would make a public declaration to this effect before another\ngeneral election came on. This had been defeated by events coming too\nsuddenly upon him, and he had no alternative but to deal with the Corn\nLaws before a national calamity would _force_ it on. The league had\nmade immense progress, and had enormous means at their disposal. If\nhe had resigned in November, Lord Stanley and the Protectionists would\nhave been prepared to form a Government, and a Revolution might have\nbeen the consequence of it. Now they felt that it was too late.\nSir Robert has _an immense scheme in view_; he thinks he shall be able\nto remove the contest entirely from the dangerous ground upon which it\nhas got--that of a war between the manufacturers, the hungry and the\npoor against the landed proprietors, the aristocracy, which can only\nend in the ruin of the latter; he will not bring forward a measure\nupon the Corn Laws, but a much more comprehensive one. He will deal\nwith the whole commercial system of the country. He will adopt\nthe principle of the League, _that of removing all protection and\nabolishing all monopoly_, but not in favour of one class and as a\ntriumph over another, but to the benefit of the nation, farmers as\nwell as manufacturers. He would begin with cotton, and take in all the\nnecessaries of life and corn amongst them. The experiments he had\nmade in 1842 and 1845 with boldness but with caution had borne out the\ncorrectness of the principle: the wool duty was taken off, and wool\nsold higher than ever before; foreign cattle were let in, and the\ncattle of England stood better in the market than ever. He would not\nask for compensation to the land, but wherever he could give it, and\nat the same time promote the social development, there he would do it,\nbut on that ground. For instance, one of the greatest benefits to\nthe country would be the establishment of a rural police on the\nsame principle as the metropolitan police. By taking this on the\nConsolidated Fund, the landowners would be immensely relieved in all\nthose counties which kept a police. One of the heaviest charges on\nthe land was the present administration of law and the carrying on of\nprosecutions. Sir Robert could fancy this to be very much improved\nby the appointment of a _public_ prosecutor by the State, which would\ngive the State a power to prevent vexatious, illegal, and immoral\nprosecutions, and reduce the expenses in an extraordinary degree. Part\nof the maintenance of the poor, according to the Poor Law, might be\nundertaken by the State. A great calamity must be foreseen, when the\ninnumerable railroads now in progress shall have been terminated,\nwhich will be the case in a few years. This will throw an enormous\nlabouring population suddenly out of employment. There might be a\nlaw passed which would provide employment for them, and improve the\nagriculture and production of the country, by enabling the State to\nadvance money to the great proprietors for the improvements of their\nestates, which they could not obtain otherwise without charging their\nestates beyond what they already have to bear.\nSir Robert means to go with Mr Gladstone into all these details.\nALBERT.",

    "body": "MY DEAR MELBOURNE,--I return you with many thanks George Anson's\nletter, which was enclosed in yours of the 23rd, which I received just\nas we were setting off for this place. Pray, when next you write to\nGeorge Anson, say how gratefully I appreciate the kind consideration\non the part of H.R.H. Prince Albert, which suggested George Anson's\ncommunication. But I can assure you that although John Russell, in his\nAudience of the Queen, may inadvertently have overstated the terms in\nwhich he had mentioned to me what Her Majesty had said to him about\nmy return to the Foreign Office, yet in his conversations with me upon\nthat subject he never said anything more than is contained in George\nAnson's letter to you; and I am sure you will think that under all the\ncircumstances of the case he could hardly have avoided telling me thus\nmuch, and making me aware of the impression which seemed to exist upon\nthe Queen's mind as to the way in which other persons might view my\nreturn to the Foreign Office.\nWith regard to Her Majesty's own sentiments, I have always been\nconvinced that Her Majesty knows me too well to believe for an instant\nthat I do not attach the greatest importance to the maintenance, not\nmerely of peace with all foreign countries, but of the most friendly\nrelations with those leading Powers and States of the world with which\nserious differences would be attended with the most inconvenience. As\nto Peace, I succeeded, as the organ of Lord Grey's Government and of\nyours, in preserving it unbroken during ten years of great and\nextraordinary difficulty; and, if now and then it unavoidably happened\nduring that period of time, that in pursuing the course of policy\nwhich seemed the best for British interests, we thwarted the views\nof this or that Foreign Power, and rendered them for the moment less\nfriendly, I think I could prove that in every case the object which we\nwere pursuing was of sufficient importance to make it worth our while\nto submit to such temporary inconvenience. There never was indeed,\nduring those ten years, any real danger of war except on three\noccasions; and on each of those occasions the course pursued by the\nBritish Government prevented war. The first occasion was just after\nthe accession of the King of the French, when Austria, Russia, and\nPrussia were disposed and preparing to attack France, and when the\nattitude assumed by the British Government prevented a rupture. The\nsecond was when England and France united by a Convention to wrest the\nCitadel of Antwerp from the Dutch, and to deliver it over to the\nKing of the Belgians. If England had not then joined with France,\nAntwerp would have remained with the Dutch, or the attempt to take it\nwould have led to a war in Europe. The third occasion was when Mehemet\nAli's army occupied Syria, and when he was constantly threatening\nto declare himself independent and to march on Constantinople; while\nRussia, on the one hand, asserted that if he did so she would occupy\nConstantinople, and on the other hand, France announced that if Russia\ndid so, she, France, would force the Dardanelles. The Treaty of July\n1840, proposed and brought about by the British Government, and the\noperations in execution of that Treaty, put an end to that danger;\nand, notwithstanding what has often been said to the contrary, the\nreal danger of war arising out of the affairs of Syria was put an end\nto, and not created by the Treaty of 1840.\nI am well aware, however, that some persons both at home and abroad\nhave imbibed the notion that I am more indifferent than I ought to be\nas to running the risk of war. That impression abroad is founded upon\nan entire mistake, but is by some sincerely felt, and being sincere,\nwould soon yield to the evidence of contradictory facts. At home that\nimpression has been industriously propagated to a limited extent,\npartly by the legitimate attacks of political opponents, and partly\nby a little cabal within our own ranks. These parties wanted to attack\nme, and were obliged to accuse me of something. They could not charge\nme with failure, because we had succeeded in all our undertakings,\nwhether in Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Syria, China, or elsewhere; they\ncould not charge me with having involved the country in war, because,\nin fact, we had maintained peace; and the only thing that was left for\nthem to say was that my policy had a _tendency_ to produce war, and I\nsuppose they would argue that it was quite wrong and against all rule\nthat it did not do so.\nBut notwithstanding what may have been said on this matter, the\ntransaction which has by some been the most criticised in this\nrespect, namely, the Treaty of 1840, and the operations connected with\nit, were entirely approved by the leaders of the then Opposition, who,\nso far from feeling any disposition to favour me, had always made a\ndetermined run at the Foreign Policy of the Whig Government. The Duke\nof Wellington, at the opening of the Session of 1841, said in\nthe House of Lords that he entirely approved our policy in that\ntransaction, and could not find that any fault had been committed\nby us in working it out; and I happen to know that Sir Robert Peel\nexpressed to the representative of one of the German Powers, parties\nto the Alliance, his entire approval of our course, while Lord\nAberdeen said to one of them, that the course I had taken in that\naffair made him forgive me many things of former years, which he had\nthought he never should have forgiven.\nI am quite ashamed of the length to which this letter has grown, and\nshall only add, with reference to our relations with France, that\nI had some very friendly interviews with Thiers, who was my chief\nantagonist in 1840, and that although we did not enter into any\nconspiracy against Guizot and Peel, as the newspapers pretended, we\nparted on very good terms, and he promised to introduce me to all his\nfriends whenever I should go to Paris, saying that of course Guizot\nwould do me the same good office with his supporters. My dear\nMelbourne, yours affectionately,\nPALMERSTON.",

The\nMembers of the Government have behaved extremely well and with much\ndisinterestedness. The Government has secured the services of Mr\nGladstone and Lord Ellenborough, who will be of great use. Lord E.\nis become very quiet, and is a very good speaker.\nWe had a very happy Christmas. This weather is extremely unwholesome.\nNow, ever your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

For the same political\nand military reason, the Governor-General hopes to be able before the\nnegotiations are closed to make arrangements by which Cashmere may be\nadded to the possessions of Gholab Singh, declaring the Rajpoot Hill\nStates with Cashmere independent of the Sikhs of the Plains. The Sikhs\ndeclare their inability to pay the indemnity of one million and a\nhalf, and will probably offer Cashmere as an equivalent. In this case,\nif Gholab Singh pays the money demanded for the expenses of the war,\nthe district of Cashmere will be ceded by the British to him, and the\nRajah become one of the Princes of Hindostan.\nThere are difficulties in the way of this arrangement, but considering\nthe military power which the Sikh nation has exhibited of bringing\ninto the field 80,000 men and 300 pieces of field artillery, it\nappears to the Governor-General most politic to diminish the means of\nthis warlike people to repeat a similar aggression. The nation is in\nfact a dangerous military Republic on our weakest frontier. If the\nBritish Army had been defeated, the Sikhs, through the Protected\nStates, which would have risen in their favour in case of a reverse,\nwould have captured Delhi, and a people having 50,000 regular troops\nand 300 pieces of field artillery in a standing permanent camp within\n50 miles of Ferozepore, is a state of things that cannot be tolerated\nfor the future....\nThe energy and intrepidity displayed by your Majesty's\nCommander-in-Chief, Sir Hugh Gough, his readiness to carry on the\nservice in cordial co-operation with the Governor-General, and the\nmarked bravery and invincibility of your Majesty's English troops,\nhave overcome many serious obstacles, and the precautions taken have\nbeen such that no disaster or failure, however trifling, has attended\nthe arduous efforts of your Majesty's Arms.",

My dearest Albert is so happy here, out all\nday planting, directing, etc., and it is so good for him. It is a\nrelief to be away from all the bitterness which people create for\nthemselves in London. Peel has a very anxious and a very peculiar\nposition, and it is the force of circumstances and the great energy\nhe _alone possesses_ which will carry him through the Session. He\ncertainly acts a most disinterested part, for did he not feel (as\n_every one_ who is fully acquainted with the _real state_ of the\ncountry must feel) that the line he pursues is the _only right_ and\nsound one for the welfare of this country, he never would have\nexposed himself to all the annoyance and pain of being attacked by his\nfriends. He was, however, determined to have done this before the next\ngeneral election, but the alarming state of distress in Ireland forced\nhim to do it now. I must, however, leave him to explain to you fully\nhimself the peculiar circumstances of the present very irregular state\nof affairs. His majority was _not_ a _certain_ one _last year_, for on\nMaynooth, upwards of a _hundred_ of his followers voted against him.\nThe state of affairs in India is very serious.

Sir Robert read\nit through and over again, and, after a long pause, said: \"I was not\naware when I spoke to your Royal Highness that my words would be taken\ndown, and don't acknowledge that this is a fair representation of my\nopinion.\" He was visibly uneasy, and added, if he knew that what he\nsaid should be committed to paper, he would speak differently, and\ngive his opinion with all the circumspection and reserve which a\nMinister ought to employ when he gave responsible advice; but he had\nin this instance spoken quite unreservedly, like an advocate defending\na point in debate, and then he had taken another and tried to carry\nthis as far as it would go, in order to give me an opportunity of\njudging of the different bearings of the question. He did so often in\nthe Cabinet, when they discussed important questions, and was often\nasked: \"Well, then, you are quite against this measure?\" \"Not at\nall, but I want that the counter argument should be gone into to the\nfullest extent, in order that the Cabinet should not take a one-sided\nview.\"\nHe viewed the existence of such a paper with much uneasiness, as it\nmight appear as if he had left this before going out of office in\norder to prepossess the Queen against the measures, which her future\nMinister might propose to her, and so lay secretly the foundation\nof his fall. The existence of such a paper might cause great\nembarrassment to the Queen; if she followed the advice of a Minister\nwho proposed measures hostile to the Irish Church, it might be said,\nshe knew what she undertook, for Sir R.

Nothing, however, would have induced him to give way before\nhe had passed the Corn Bill and the Tariff. The majority upon the\nIrish Bill was much larger than any one had expected; Sir Robert was\nglad of this, however, as it convinced his colleagues of the necessity\nof resigning. He told them at the Cabinet that, as for himself\npersonally, he had made up his mind to resign, and on being asked\nwhat he advised his Cabinet to do, he recommended them to do the\nsame, which received general concurrence. The last weeks had not been\nwithout some intrigue. There was a party headed by Lord Ellenborough\nand Lord Brougham, who wished Sir Robert and Sir James Graham to\nretire, and for the rest of the Cabinet to reunite with the Protection\nsection of the Conservatives, and to carry on the Government. Lord\nEllenborough and Lord Brougham had in December last settled to head\nthe Protectionists, but this combination had been broken up by Lord\nEllenborough's acceptance of the post of First Lord of the Admiralty;\nLord Brougham then declared for free trade, perhaps in order to follow\nLord Ellenborough into office. The Duke of Wellington had been for\ndissolution till he saw the complete disorganisation of his party\nin the House of Lords. The Whigs, having been beat twice the evening\nbefore by large majorities on the Roman Catholic Bill, had made every\nexertion on the Coercion Bill, and the majority was still increased by\nSir Robert's advising the Free Traders and Radicals, who had intended\nto stay away in order not to endanger Sir Robert's Government, not to\ndo so as they would not be able to save him. Seventy Protectionists\nvoted with the majority.\nBefore leaving Town Sir R. Peel addressed a letter to Lord John\nRussell, informing him that he was going to the Isle of Wight in order\nto tender his and his colleagues' resignation to the Queen, that he\ndid not the least know what Her Majesty's intentions were, but that in\ncase she should send for Lord John, he (Sir Robert) was ready to see\nLord John (should he wish it), and give him any explanation as to\nthe state of public affairs and Parliamentary business which he could\ndesire. Sir Robert thought thereby, without in the least committing\nthe Queen, to indicate to Lord John that he had nothing to fear on his\npart, and that, on the contrary, he could reckon upon his assistance\nin starting the Queen's new Government. He hoped likewise that this\nwould tend to dispel a clamour for dissolution which the Whigs have\nraised, alarmed by their defeats upon the Catholic Bill.\nALBERT.",

By-and-by he rose, amidst\na breathless silence, and made the speech you will have read long ere\nthis. It was very fine: very effective: really almost solemn: to fall\nat such a moment. He spoke as if it was his last political scene: as\nif he felt that between alienated friends and unwon foes he could\nhave no party again; and could only as a shrewd bystander observe and\nadvise others. There was but one point in the Speech which I thought\ndoubtful: the apostrophe to \"Richard Cobden.\" I think it was\nwrong, though there is very much to be said for it. The opening of the\nAmerican peace was noble; but for the future, what have we to look to?\nAlready there are whispers of Palmerston and War; the Whig budget and\ndeficiency. The first great question all men ask is: does Lord John\ncome in, leaning on Radical or Conservative aid? Is Hawes to be in the\nCabinet? the first Dissenter? the first tradesman? the Irish Church?

We concurred in this opinion, but Lord John was authorised\nby Victoria to make the offer. Mr F. Baring, the Chancellor of the\nExchequer under the late Whig Government, has intimated to Lord John\nthat he would prefer if no offer of office was made to him; Lord John\nwould therefore recommend Mr Charles Wood for this office.

His speech in the\nHouse of Lords at the beginning of the session had done much harm,\nhad been very extreme, and Lord John was decidedly against him in\nthat. Lord Grey knew that everybody blamed it, but said everybody\nwould be of those (his) opinions ten years hence, and therefore he\nmight just as well hold them now. Mr Wood having great influence with\nhim might keep him quiet, and so would the Colonial seals, as he would\nget work enough. About Lord Palmerston, he is satisfied, and would no\nmore make any difficulty.\nLord John Russell told me in the evening that he had forgotten to\nmention one subject to the Queen: it was that Sir Robert Peel by his\nspeech and his special mention of Mr Cobden as the person who had\ncarried the great measure, had made it very difficult for Lord John\nnot to offer office to Mr Cobden. The Whigs were already accused of\nbeing exclusive, and reaping the harvest of other people's work. The\nonly thing he could offer would be a _Cabinet_ office. Now this would\naffront a great many people whom he (Lord J.) had to conciliate, and\ncreate even possibly dissension in his Cabinet. As Mr Cobden was going\non the Continent for a year, Lord John was advised by Lord Clarendon\nto write to Mr C., and tell him that he had heard he was going\nabroad, that he would not make any offer to him therefore, but that\nhe considered him as entitled once to be recommended for office to the\nQueen. This he would do, with the Queen's permission....",

    "body": "Yesterday the new Ministry were installed at a Privy Council, and the\nSeals of Office transferred to them. We had a long conversation with\nSir Robert Peel, who took leave. I mentioned to him that his word\nof \"Richard Cobden\" had created an immense sensation, but he was not\ninclined to enter upon the subject. When we begged him to do nothing\nwhich could widen the breach between him and his party, he said, \"I\ndon't think that we can ever get together again.\" He repeated that he\nwas anxious not to undertake a Government again, that his health would\nnot stand it, that it was better likewise for the Queen's service\nthat other, younger men should be brought forward. Sir Robert, Lord\nAberdeen, and Sir James Graham parted with great emotion, and had\ntears in their eyes when they thanked the Queen for her confidence\nand support. Lord Aberdeen means to have an interview with Lord\nPalmerston, and says that when he (Lord A.) came into office, Lord\nPalmerston and the _Chronicle_ assailed him most bitterly as an\nimbecile Minister, a traitor to his country, etc., etc. He means now\nto show Lord P. the contrast by declaring his readiness to assist him\nin every way he can by his advice, that he would at all times speak to\nhim as if he was his colleague if he wished it.\nThe new Court is nearly completed, and we have succeeded in obtaining\na very respectable and proper one, notwithstanding the run which\nthe Party made upon it which had been formerly used to settle these\nmatters, to _their_ liking only. The Government is not a united one,\nhowever, by any means. Mr Wood and Lord Clarendon take the greatest\ncredit in having induced Lord Grey to join the Government, and are\nresponsible to Lord John to keep him quiet, which they think they will\nbe able to do, as he had been convinced of the folly of his former\nline of conduct. Still, they say Lord Lansdowne will have the lead\nonly nominally, that Lord Grey is to take it really in the House\nof Lords. There is the _Grey Party_, consisting of Lord Grey, Lord\nClarendon, Sir George Grey, and Mr Wood; they are against Lord\nLansdowne, Lord Minto, Lord Auckland, and Sir John Hobhouse,\nstigmatising them as old women. Lord John leans entirely to the\nlast-named gentlemen. There is no cordiality between Lord John and\nLord Palmerston, who, if he had to make a choice, would even forget\nwhat passed in December last, and join the Grey Party in preference to\nLord John personally. The curious part of all this is that they\ncannot keep a secret, and speak of all their differences. They got\nthe _Times_ over by giving it exclusive information, and the leading\narticles are sent in and praise the new Cabinet, but the wicked paper\nadded immediately a furious attack upon Sir John Hobhouse, which\nalarmed them so much that they sent to Sir John, sounding him, whether\nhe would be hereafter prepared to relinquish the Board of Control.\n(This, however, is a mere personal matter of Mr Walter, who stood\nagainst Sir John at Nottingham in 1841 and was unseated.) Sir John\nEasthope, the proprietor of the _Morning Chronicle_, complains\nbitterly of the subserviency to the _Times_ and treason to him. He\nsays he knows that the information was sent from Lord John's house,\nand threatens revenge. \"If you will be ruled by the _Times_,\" he\nsaid to one of the Cabinet, \"the _Times_ has shown you already by a\nspecimen that you will be ruled by a rod of iron.\"\nA Brevet for the Army and Navy is proposed, in order to satisfy Lord\nAnglesey with the dignity of Field-Marshal.\nALBERT.\nThe Protectionists, 150 strong, including Peers and M.P.'s, are to\ngive a dinner to Lord Stanley at Greenwich, at which he is to announce\nhis opinions upon the line they are to take. Lord George Bentinck is\nthere to lay down the lead which the Party insisted upon. Who is to\nfollow him as their leader in the Commons nobody knows.",

Peel and Lord Aberdeen, who are irreparable losses\nto us and the Country; they were both so much overcome that it quite\noverset me, and we have in them two devoted friends. We felt so safe\nwith them. Never, during the five years that they were with me, did\nthey _ever_ recommend a _person_ or a thing which was not for my or\nthe Country's best, and never for the Party's advantage only; and the\ncontrast _now_ is very striking; there is much less respect and much\nless high and pure feeling. Then the discretion of Peel, I believe, is\nunexampled.\nStockmar has, I know, explained to you the state of affairs, which\nis unexampled, and I think the present Government _very_ weak and\nextremely disunited. What may appear to you as a mistake in November\nwas an inevitable evil. Aberdeen very truly explained it yesterday.\n\"We had ill luck,\" he said; \"if it had not been for this famine in\nIreland, which rendered immediate measures necessary, Sir Robert would\nhave prepared them gradually for the change.\" Then, besides, the Corn\nLaw Agitation was such that if Peel had not wisely made this change\n(for which the _whole_ Country blesses him), a convulsion would\nshortly have taken place, and we should have been _forced_ to yield\nwhat has been granted as a boon. No doubt the breaking up of the Party\n(which _will_ come together again, whether under Peel or some one\nelse) is a very distressing thing. The only thing to be regretted, and\nI do not know exactly _why_ he did it (though we _can_ guess), was his\npraise of _Cobden_, which has shocked people a good deal.\nBut I can't tell you how sad I am to lose Aberdeen; you can't think\nwhat a delightful companion he was; the breaking up of all this\nintercourse during our journeys, etc., is deplorable.\nWe have contrived to get a _very_ respectable Court.\nAlbert's use to me, and I may say to the _Country_, by his firmness\nand sagacity, is beyond all belief in these moments of trial.\nWe are all well, but I am, of course, a good deal overset by all these\ntribulations.\nEver your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.\nI was much touched to see Graham so very much overcome at taking leave\nof us.",

With regard to the marriage of the Queen of Spain, Viscount\nPalmerston has received a good deal of general information from\npersons who have conversed with him on the subject, but he has learnt\nnothing thereupon which was not already known to your Majesty. The\nstate of that matter seems, in a few words, to be that the Count\nof Trapani is now quite out of the question, that the Count of\nMontemolin, though wished for by Austria, and in some degree supported\nby the Court of the Tuileries, would be an impossible choice, and that\nthe alternative now lies between Don Enrique and the Prince Leopold\nof Coburg, the two Queens being equally set against the Duke of Cadiz,\nDon Enrique's elder brother. In favour of Prince Leopold seem to be\nthe two Queens, and a party (of what extent and influence does not\nappear) in Spain. Against that Prince are arrayed, ostensibly at\nleast, the Court of the Tuileries and the Liberal Party in Spain; and\nprobably to a certain degree the Government of Austria.\nIn favour of Don Enrique are a very large portion of the Spanish\nnation, who would prefer a Spanish prince for their Sovereign's\nhusband; and the preference, expressed only as an opinion and without\nany acts in furtherance of it, by your Majesty's late Administration.\nAgainst Don Enrique are the aversion of the Queen Mother, founded on\nher family differences with her late sister, and the apprehensions of\nthe present Ministers in Spain, who would think their power endangered\nby the political connection between Don Enrique and the more Liberal\nParty. The sentiments of the King of the French in regard to Don\nEnrique seem not very decided; but it appears likely that the King of\nthe French would prefer Count Montemolin or the Duke of Cadiz to Don\nEnrique; but that he would prefer Don Enrique to the Prince Leopold of\nCoburg, because the former would fall within the category of Bourbon\nprinces, descended from Philip the Fifth of Spain, proposed by the\nKing of the French as the limited circle within which the Queen of\nSpain should find a husband.",

The Queen trusts, moreover, that late experience\nand good sense may induce the West Indians to be moderate and\naccommodating. As Lord John touches in his letter on the possibility\nof a Dissolution, the Queen thinks it right to put Lord John in\npossession of her views upon this subject _generally_. She considers\nthe power of dissolving Parliament a most valuable and powerful\ninstrument in the hands of the Crown, but which ought not to be used\nexcept in extreme cases and with a certainty of success. To use this\ninstrument and be defeated is a thing most lowering to the Crown\nand hurtful to the country. The Queen strongly feels that she made\na mistake in allowing the Dissolution in 1841; the result has been a\nmajority returned against her of nearly one hundred votes; but suppose\nthe result to have been nearly an equality of votes between the two\ncontending parties, the Queen would have thrown away her last remedy,\nand it would have been impossible for her to get any Government which\ncould have carried on public business with a chance of success.\nThe Queen was glad therefore to see that Sir Robert Peel did not ask\nfor a Dissolution, and she _entirely concurs_ in the opinion expressed\nby him in his last speech in the House of Commons, when he said:\n\"I feel strongly this, that no Administration is justified in advising\nthe exercise of that prerogative, unless there be a fair, reasonable\npresumption, even a strong moral conviction, that after a Dissolution\nthey will be enabled to administer the affairs of this country through\nthe support of a party sufficiently powerful to carry their measures.\nI do not think a Dissolution justifiable to strengthen a party. I\nthink the power of Dissolution is a great instrument in the hands of\nthe Crown, and that there is a tendency to blunt that instrument if it\nbe resorted to without necessity.\n\"The only ground for Dissolution would have been a strong presumption\nthat after a Dissolution we should have had a party powerful enough in\nthis House to give effect practically to the measures which we might\npropose. I do not mean a support founded on a concurrence on _one\ngreat question of domestic policy_, however important that may be, not\nof those who differ from us on almost all questions of public policy,\nagreeing with us in one; but that we should have the support of a\npowerful party united by a general concurrence of political opinions.\"\nThe Queen is confident that these views will be in accordance with\nLord John Russell's own sentiments and opinions upon this subject.",

The\nperusal of it has raised some apprehensions in the Queen's mind,\nwhich she stated to Lord Palmerston she would communicate to Lord John\nRussell.\nThe draft lays down a general policy, which the Queen is afraid may\nultimately turn out very dangerous. It is this:\nEngland undertakes to interfere in the internal affairs of Spain, and\nto promote the development of the present constitutional Government of\nSpain in a more democratic direction, and this for the avowed purpose\nof counteracting the influence of France. England becomes therefore\n_responsible_ for a particular direction given to the _internal_\nGovernment of Spain, which to control she has no sufficient means. All\nEngland can do, and will have to do, is: to keep up a particular party\nin Spain to support her views.\nFrance, knowing that this is directed against her, must take up the\nopposite party and follow the opposite policy in Spanish affairs.\nThis must bring England and France to quarrels, of which we can hardly\nforesee the consequences, and it dooms Spain to eternal convulsions\nand reactions.\nThis has been the state of things before; theory and experience\ntherefore warn against the renewal of a similar policy.\nThe natural consequence of this is that Don Enrique would appear\nas the desirable candidate for the Queen of Spain's hand, and Lord\nPalmerston accordingly for the first time deviates from the line\nhitherto followed by us, and _urges_ Don Enrique, which in the eyes of\nthe world must stamp him as \"_an English Candidate_.\" Lord Palmerston,\nfrom his wish to see him succeed, does, in the Queen's opinion, not\nsufficiently acknowledge the obstacles which stand in the way of\nthis combination, and which all those who are on the spot and in the\nconfidence of the Court represent as almost insurmountable.\nThe Queen desires Lord John Russell to weigh all this most maturely,\nand to let her know the result.",

    "body": "Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has\nendeavoured to modify and rearrange his proposed instruction to Mr\nBulwer in deference to your Majesty's wishes and feelings as expressed\nto Lord John Russell; and with this view also Viscount Palmerston has\ndivided the instruction into two separate despatches--the one treating\nof the proposed marriage of the Queen, the other of the possible\nmarriage of the Infanta. But with regard to these new drafts, as well\nas with regard to the former one, Viscount Palmerston would beg\nto submit that they are not notes to be presented to any Foreign\nGovernment, nor despatches to be in any way made public; but that they\nare confidential instructions given to one of your Majesty's Ministers\nabroad, upon matters upon which your Majesty's Government have been\nurgently pressed, to enable that Minister to give advice; and Viscount\nPalmerston would beg also to submit that in a case of this kind it\nwould not be enough to communicate drily the opinion of the British\nGovernment, without stating and explaining some of the reasons upon\nwhich those opinions are founded.\nIt is quite evident from Mr Bulwer's communication, and especially\nfrom the postscript to his despatch of the 4th of this month, that\nQueen Christina, the Duke of Rianzares, and Se\u00f1or Isturitz, are\nearnestly and intently bent upon marrying the Queen Isabella to Prince\nLeopold of Saxe-Coburg, and it is very difficult to find conclusive\ngrounds for saying that such a match would not perhaps, on the whole,\nbe the best for Queen Isabella and the Spanish nation. But still, all\nthings considered, your Majesty's Government incline to the opinion\nthat a Spanish Prince would be a preferable choice, and they are\nprepared to give that opinion to the Spanish Court.\nThere is however but one Spanish Prince whom it would be creditable\nto the British Government to recommend as husband to the Queen, and to\nthat Prince Queen Christina is known to feel objections, principally\nfounded upon apprehensions bearing upon her own personal interests.\nViscount Palmerston has endeavoured to furnish Mr Bulwer with such\narguments in favour of Don Enrique as appeared likely to meet Queen\nChristina's fears, and he has occasion to believe, from a conversation\nwhich he had a few days ago with Count Jarnac, that the French\nGovernment, impelled by the apprehension that your Majesty's\nGovernment intend to support Prince Leopold of Coburg, would be\nwilling, in order to draw the British Government off from such a\ncourse, to give at least an ostensible though perhaps not a very\nearnest support to Don Henry. But your Majesty will no doubt at\nonce perceive that although the British Government may come to an\nunderstanding with that of France as to which of the candidates shall\nbe the one in whose favour an opinion is to be expressed, it would be\nimpossible for the British Government to associate itself with that of\nFrance in any joint step to be taken upon this matter, and that each\nGovernment must act separately through its own agent at Madrid. For\nthe two Governments have not only different objects in view in these\nmatters, England wishing Spain to be independent, and France desiring\nto establish a predominant influence in Spain; but moreover, in regard\nto this marriage question, Great Britain has disclaimed any right to\ninterfere except by opinion and advice, while France has assumed\nan authority of dictation, and it is essential that your Majesty's\nGovernment should so shape the mode of co-operating with France as not\nto appear to sanction pretensions which are founded in no right and\nare inconsistent with justice.\nViscount Palmerston is by no means confident that the joint advice of\nthe British and French Governments in favour of Don Enrique will be\nsuccessful, and especially because he fears that M. Bresson has taken\nso active a part in favour of other arrangements, that he will not be\nvery eager in support of Don Enrique, and will perhaps think that if\nthis arrangement can be rendered impossible the chances may become\ngreater in favour of some other arrangement which he and his\nGovernment may prefer. But such future embarrassments must be dealt\nwith when they arise, and Viscount Palmerston submits that for the\nmoment, unless the British Government had been prepared to close with\nthe offers of the Duke of Rianzares, and to follow at once the course\nrecommended by Mr Bulwer, the steps suggested in the accompanying\ndrafts are the safest and the best.\nViscount Palmerston has great pleasure in submitting the accompanying\nprivate letter from Mr Bulwer announcing the withdrawal of the Spanish\ntroops from the frontier of Portugal.",

Queen\nChristina, I understand, spoke to her daughter and told her she\nmust choose one of two things, either marrying now, or deferring the\nmarriage for three or four years. That the Prince of Saxe-Coburg was\nevidently impossible; that Count Trapani would be dangerous; that Don\nHenry had placed himself in a position which rendered the alliance\nwith him out of the question, and that Her Majesty must either make up\nher mind to marry her cousin Don Francisco de Asis, or to abandon for\nsome time the idea of marrying.\nThe Queen, I am told, took some little time to consider, and then\ndecided in favour of her cousin.

Albert has told\nyou all that passed between the dear Queen and me, and the very absurd\nground on which the French make their stand. The details of the story\nare very bad--and I grieve to say that the good King, etc., have\nbehaved _very dishonestly_.\nWe have protested, and mean to protest very strongly, against\nMontpensier's marriage with the Infanta, _as long as she is\npresumptive heiress to the Throne of Spain_. The King departs from his\nprinciple, for _he insisted_ on a _Bourbon_, _because_ he declared he\nwould _not_ marry one of his sons to the Queen; and now he effects the\nQueen's marriage with the worst Bourbon she could have, and marries\nhis son to the Infanta, who in all probability will become Queen!\nIt is very bad. Certainly at Madrid [Palmerston] mismanaged it--as\nStockmar says--by forcing Don Enrique, in spite of all Bulwer could\nsay. If our dear Aberdeen was still at his post, the whole thing would\nnot have happened; for he would _not_ have forced Enriquito (which\nenraged Christine), and secondly, Guizot would not have _escamot\u00e9_\nAberdeen with the wish of triumphing over him as he has done over\nPalmerston, who has behaved most openly and fairly towards France, I\nmust say, in this affair.

And it is such a\npersonal sort of a quarrel, which pains and grieves me so; and I pity\nthe poor good Piat, whom we are very fond of. One thing, however,\nI feel, that in opposing this marriage, we are not really affecting\nhis happiness, for he has never seen the Infanta--and she is a child\nof fourteen, and not pretty. The little Queen I pity so much, for\nthe poor child dislikes her cousin, and she is said to have consented\n_against her will_. We shall see if she really does marry him.\nAltogether, it is most annoying, and must ruffle our happy intercourse\nwith the French family for a time at least.\nI was obliged to write very strongly and openly to poor dear Louise\ntoo.

Since I wrote to you we have decided to\nremonstrate both at Madrid (this went a week ago), and at Paris, but\nthis last not in a formal note but in a despatch to Lord Normanby,\nagainst this very unjustifiable breach of faith on the part of France.\nWe have seen these despatches, which are very firm, but written in a\nvery proper and kind tone, exposing at the same time the fallacy\nof what has been done; for the King himself declared that he would\n_never_ let _one of his sons marry_ the Queen, he _insisted_ on her\nmarrying a descendant of Philip V. This has been done, and at the same\nmoment he says his _son_ is to marry the _Infanta_, who may _become\nQueen to-morrow!_And to all this he says, \"C'est seulement une\naffaire de famille\"! The King is very fond of England, and still more\nof peace, and he never _can_ sacrifice this (for though it would\nnot be immediate war it would cause coolness with us and with other\nPowers, and would probably lead to war in a short time), for a\nbreach of faith and _for one of his sons'_ marriages.

You say that the King thinks\nme _resentful_; this is extraordinary, for I have no such feeling; my\nfeelings were and are _deeply_ wounded at the unhandsome and secret\nmanner (so totally, in _letter_ and _in meaning_, contrary to an\n_entente cordiale_) in which this affair was settled, and in which the\ntwo marriages were incorporated.\nWhat can I do?\nThe King and French Government never _expressed regret_ at the sudden\nand _unhandsome_ manner, to say the _least_, in which they behaved to\ntheir _best ally_ and _friend_, and _we_ really _cannot admit_ that\n_they have to forgive us for duping us!_Why have they not tried to\nmake _some_ sort of apology? What do I do, but remain silent _for the\npresent_?\nIt is a sad affair, but _resentment_ I have none whatever, and this\naccusation is a new version of the affair.\nWith respect to Portugal, I refute most positively the unfounded\naccusations against us; we _cannot_ interfere in internal dissensions\nbeyond ensuring the personal safety of the King, Queen, and Royal\nFamily. The Constitution may be, and I believe is, an unfortunate\nthing in those Southern countries; but once it is established, the\nQueen must abide by it; but, unfortunately, the _coup de main_ in\nsending away Palmella's Government (which would inevitably have\ncrumbled to pieces of itself), was both unconstitutional and unsafe,\nand I fear they are in a much worse position _vis-\u00e0-vis_ of the\ncountry than they ever were.\nWe are all going to-morrow to Osborne for four weeks.

The circulation of notes approaches nineteen millions.\nUpon fully considering the difficulty of finding a person of ability\nand experience to place at the head of the Poor Law Commission, Lord\nJohn Russell has come to the conclusion that the best course he can\ntake is to propose to Mr Cobden to accept the Presidency with a seat\nin the Cabinet, and to propose to the Duke of Bedford at the same time\na seat in the Cabinet without office.\nVarious reasons for making this offer to Mr Cobden will occur to your\nMajesty.

I took the liberty to propose my beloved and truly\namiable town of Neuch\u00e2tel as the place for the Conference, not only\nbecause its position in neutral territory and in Switzerland\nherself qualifies it above every other place for that purpose, but\n_particularly_ because this meeting of the representatives of the\ngreat Powers there would protect it and the courageous and faithful\ncountry of Neuch\u00e2tel from indignities, spoliation, and all the\n_horrors_ which oppress at this moment the unfortunate and far from\ncourageous Fribourg. I am afraid that your Majesty has not a full\nappreciation of the people and the partisans who fill Switzerland\nwith murders and the miseries of the most abominable Civil War. Your\nMajesty's happy realms have centuries ago passed through the \"phase\"\nof such horrors, and with you the state of parties has been (as one\nsays here) grown in bottles, under the glorious Constitution given\nby God and History, but _not_ \"made\"; but there, in Switzerland, a\nparty is becoming victorious!!! which, notwithstanding the exercise\nof Christian charity, can only be called \"_Gottlos und Rechtlos_\"\n(without God and without right). For Germany, the saving of\nSwitzerland from the hands of the Radicals is _simply_ a _vital\nquestion_. If they are victorious there, in Germany likewise torrents\nof blood will flow; I will answer for that. The murder of Kings,\nPriests, and Aristocrats is no empty sound with them, and Civil War in\nsong, writing, word, and deed, is their watchword. \"Toute charit\u00e9 bien\nentendue commence par soi-m\u00eame.\" So they begin with their own country,\ntrue to this \"Christian\" (!) motto. If they are allowed to proceed,\nsurely they _won't stop there_. Thousands of emigrated malefactors\nwait only for a sign (which their comrades and allies in Germany will\nnot be backward in giving) to pour forth beyond the German frontier.\nIn Germany the PEOPLE are just as little fond of them as they were in\nSwitzerland, but the experience of Switzerland teaches us that\nthat alone cannot stem their victorious march, if circumstances are\nfavourable to them. The German people rely upon their Governments, and\ndo nothing, but Governments are weakened by the modern Liberalism\n(the precursor of Radicalism, as the dying of chickens precedes\nthe Cholera) and will have to take the consequences of their own\nnegligence. Notwithstanding people and princes, that godless band will\nmarch through Germany, because, though small, it is strong through\nbeing united and determined. All this I have pondered in my head and\nheart (led, so to say, by the hand of History), and that has prompted\nme now to propose that the German Confederation (which _en parenth\u00e8se_\nincludes a population of more than forty millions) should appear\nas one of the great Powers of Europe at the settlement of the Swiss\ndispute, and should be admitted as such by the other great Powers.\n_Would your Majesty do justice, and give_ PROTECTION _to this\nidea_?...\nF.

I had proposed London as\nthe place of conference, but should with pleasure have waived this\nproposition to adopt the place which you have expressed a wish of\nseeing fixed for that purpose, viz. Neuch\u00e2tel, and I should have felt\ntruly happy if by so doing I could have met your wishes, and given\nfurther protection to the principality against possible aggressions\non the part of the Federal Government of Switzerland. As matters\nnow stand, the only complication which might arise is that between\nNeuch\u00e2tel and the Diet. I have, in anticipation of any such event,\ninstructed Sir Stratford Canning to exert himself to his utmost to\ndissuade the Diet from any plan of aggression on your territory, and\nhe has been furnished with an able and elaborate state paper for his\nguidance, which Chevalier Bunsen had drawn up, discussing the legal\nmerits of the case. Should events prove that Sir S. Canning did\nnot arrive in time, or had not the power of averting a hostile step\nagainst Neuch\u00e2tel, you may rely upon my readiness at all times to\nput my good offices at your disposal. Should a conference upon Swiss\naffairs still become necessary, I conceive that the only plea upon\nwhich the great Powers could meet in conference would be their having\nguaranteed the independence and neutrality of Switzerland, and by\nimplication the Federal Compact amongst the Cantons. This has not been\nthe case with regard to the German Confederation, and I do not readily\nsee in consequence how the Confederation could be admitted into this\nConference, however much I confess I would like to see Germany take\nher place amongst the Powers of Europe, to which her strength and\npopulation fairly entitle her. I may say that my Government are\nequally impressed with me with the importance of German unity and\nstrength and of this strength weighing in the balance of power\nof Europe; I am sure that the English public generally share this\nfeeling, but I must not conceal from your Majesty that much would\ndepend upon the manner in which this power was represented. Much\nas the English would like to see this power represented by the\nenlightened councils of your Majesty, they would be animated with very\ndifferent feelings in seeing it in the hands of Prince Metternich ...\nVICTORIA R.",

The loss of my good, excellent, beloved Aunt is an _immense\nmisfortune_ for _us all_, and the most _dreadful blow_ for my poor\nFather. We are all broken-hearted by this, at last _unexpected_ event.\nSome years we were uneasy about my poor Aunt's health, and of late\nI had been particularly alarmed by what I heard of her increasing\nweakness; but I was very far from believing that her end was _so\nnear_. I was only anxious for the winter. At least her end was\npeaceful. She went to sleep and did not wake more. She died without a\nstruggle; the horror of death, and the still greater pang of the last\nfarewell, of the last leave-taking of her beloved brother, was spared\nher. I thank God for _this_ proof of His mercy, and hope He will\nkeep up my Father under _such a heavy affliction_. To him the loss is\n_irretrievable_. My Aunt lived _but_ for him; one may almost say\nthat her affection alone had kept her alive these last years, and a\ndevotion like hers--that devotion of all instants--so complete, so\nfull of self-denial--cannot, will never, be replaced. A heart _like\nhers_, so true, so noble, so warm, so loving, so devoted, is _rarely_\nseen. To us also, independently of my Father, the loss is a _dreadful_\none. My Aunt was a second mother for us; we loved her and looked up to\nher in this way, and certainly few mothers do for their children what\nshe did for us, or loved them better. We are overwhelmed with grief by\nthe sudden disappearance of a being _so dear_ and _so necessary_ to us\nall, and we go to-morrow to Paris, to mourn with the remainder of the\nfamily, and offer my poor Father the only consolation he can feel at\nthis cruel moment, that of being surrounded by all those he loves.\nI have still so much to do previous to our melancholy journey that\nI cannot say more to-day. I am sure you will excuse me. I shall, God\nwilling, write in a more proper way the next time. In the meanwhile I\nthank God that you are _unberufen_ all well, and, in sorrow or in joy,\nI am equally, my beloved Victoria, from the bottom of my heart, yours\nmost devotedly,\nLOUISE.",

I was still in his rooms--where the\nfamily has been breakfasting and dining till now--when your letter\narrived; he was so delighted with it that he _kissed it most\ntenderly_. I left him tolerably well on Monday, but with rather a\nsevere cold. He had certainly at the end of December the Grippe,\nwhich perhaps was the immediate cause of poor Aunt's death, as from\nover-anxiety for her beloved brother, she got up in the night to find\nout how he was. His cold had been better when he went to Dreux, then\nhe met the procession, and walked with it bareheaded to the church;\nthis seems to have given him a new cold. His nerves are also a good\ndeal shaken, and this renders him very irritable. He is much occupied\nabout some of the arrangements connected with poor Aunt's fortune;\nshe left her landed property to Nemours, Joinville, and Montpensier,\ncharged with the various sums she left to nearly all the branches of\nher family. The King is to have, however, the enjoyment of the whole\nof this fortune for his life. His great wish would be to employ the\nrevenues, from the whole of the succession legacies as well as landed\nproperty, to free the landed property of the mortgage of the various\nlegacies. This will require a good many years, and I told him that it\nwould force him to live till it would be arranged, which will easily\nrequire ten years. In France a good feeling has been shown on this\noccasion. I heard from trustworthy quarters that even people who were\nknown to be personally not very kind to the King, expressed themselves\nmost anxious for his preservation. Whenever that sad event will take\nplace, the reaction in Europe will be great, as all the bad passions\nwhich are kept down by him will then of course try to get the over\nhand. The Queen is much affected by all this, and thinks much of her\nown end. The children, including good H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, have all behaved\nwith the utmost affection to their parents, and nothing can equal\nparticularly good Nemours' devotion and attention. My beloved Child,\nyour truly devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

    "body": "MOST GRACIOUS QUEEN AND SISTER,--Even at this midnight hour of the\nday, on the evening of which the awful news from Paris has arrived,\nI venture to address these lines to your Majesty. God has permitted\nevents which decisively threaten the peace of Europe.\nIt is an attempt to \"spread the principles of the Revolution by\n_every_ means throughout the whole of Europe.\" This programme binds\ntogether both these individuals and their parties. The consequences\nfor the peace of the world are _clear_ and _certain_. If the\nrevolutionary party carries out its programme, \"The sovereignty of\nthe people,\" my minor crown will be broken, no less certainly than the\nmighty crowns of your Majesty, and a fearful scourge will be laid upon\nthe nations; a century [will follow] of rebellion, of lawlessness, and\nof godlessness. The late King did not dare to write \"by the Grace\nof God.\" _We_, however, call ourselves King \"by the Grace of God,\"\nbecause it is true. Well, then, most gracious Queen, let us now show\nto men, to the peoples threatened with disruption and nameless misery,\nboth _that_ we understand our sacred office and _how_ we understand\nit. God has placed in your Majesty's hands, in the hands of the two\nEmperors, in those of the German Federation, and in mine, a power,\nwhich, if it now acts in union and harmony, with reliance on Heaven,\nis able humanly speaking, to enforce, with certainty, the maintenance\nof the peace of the world. This power is _not that of arms_, for\nthese, more than ever, must only afford the _ultima ratio_.\nThe power I mean is \"the power of united speech.\" In the year 1830\nthe use of this immeasurable power was criminally neglected. But now I\nthink the danger is much more pressing than it was then. This power is\ndivided among _us_ in equal portions. I possess the smallest portion\nof it, and your Majesty has by far the greatest share. That share is\nso great that your Majesty, by your powerful word, might alone carry\nout the task. But the certainty of victory lies, subject to the Divine\nblessing, solely in our utterance being united. This must be our\nmessage to France; \"that all of us are cordial well-wishers to France;\nwe do not grudge her all possible welfare and glory; we mean never to\nencroach on it, and we will stand by the new Government as by the old,\n_foi de gentils-hommes_. But the first breach of the peace, be it with\nreference to Italy, Belgium, or Germany would be, undoubtedly and at\nthe same time, a breach with 'all of us,' and we should, with all the\npower that God has given us, let France feel by _sea_ and by _land_,\nas in the years '13, '14, and '15, what our union may mean.\"\n_Now_ I bless Providence for having placed Lord Palmerston at the head\nof your Foreign Office, and keeping him there at this very moment.\nDuring the last quarter of the past year I could not always cordially\nagree with him. His genuine British disposition will honour this open\nconfession. All the more frankly may I now express the hopes which\nrise in me, from the very fact of _his_ holding that office at the\npresent moment; for a more active, more vivid, more energetic Minister\nof foreign affairs, a man that would more indefatigably pursue great\naims, your Majesty could probably never have. If at this grave hour\nhe sets himself to proclaim that our forces are united; if he himself\nutters his message as befits St George, he will earn the blessing of\nmillions, and the blessing of God and of the world will rest on your\nMajesty's sacred head. That I am your Majesty's and _Old England's_\nmost faithful and most devoted brother and companion, you are aware,\nand I mean to prove it. On both, knees I adjure you, use, for the\nwelfare of Europe, \"_Engellands England_.\"\nWith these words I fall at your Majesty's feet, most gracious Queen,\nand remain your Majesty's most faithfully devoted, most attached\nServant and good Brother,\nFREDERIC WILLIAM.\n_P. S._--The Prince I embrace. He surely feels with me, and justly\nappraises my endeavours.\n_Post scriptum, 28th, in the evening._\nI venture to open my letter again, for this day has brought us news\nfrom France, which one can only call _horrible_. According to what\nwe hear, there is no longer left a King in France. A regency, a\ngovernment, and the most complete anarchy has ensued, under the name\nof the Republic--a condition of things in which, at first, there will\nbe no possibility of communicating with the people, infuriated with\ncrime. In case a Government should evolve itself out of this chaos, I\nconscientiously hold that the \"united word\" of the great Powers, such\nas I have indicated in the preceding pages, should be made known,\n_without any modification, to the new holders of power_. Your\nMajesty's gracious friendship will certainly not take amiss this\naddition to my letter, though it be not conformable to strict\netiquette.\nThe fate of the poor old King, of the Duchess of Orleans, of the whole\nhonourable and amiable family, cuts me to the heart, for up to this\ntime we do not know what has become of any of them. We owe Louis\nPhilippe eighteen happy years of peace. No noble heart must forget\nthat. And yet--who would not recognise the avenging hand of the King\nof kings in all this?\nI kiss your Majesty's hands.",

    "body": "MY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--_What a misfortune! What_ an _awful,\noverwhelming, unexpected_ and _inexplicable catastrophe_. _Is it\npossible_ that we should witness _such events_, and that _this_ should\nbe the end of nearly eighteen years of courageous and successful\nefforts to maintain order, peace, and make France happy, what _she\nwas_? I have heard, I read hourly, _what has happened: I cannot\nbelieve it yet_; but if _my beloved parents_ and the remainder of\nthe family are at least _safe_ I won't mind the rest. In the hours of\nagony we have gone through I asked God _only_ to spare _the lives_,\nand I ask still _nothing else_: but we don't know them yet _all_\nsaved, and till I have heard of my unfortunate parents, of my unhappy\nbrothers far away, of all those for whom I would lay my life at any\nmoment and whose danger I could not even share or alleviate, I cannot\nexist.\nI was _sure_, my beloved Victoria, of all _you_ would _feel for us_\nwhen you would hear of these awful events. I received yesterday your\ntwo kind, warm, sympathising letters of the 25th and 26th, and thank\nyou with _all my heart_ for them, and for yours and Albert's share and\nsympathy.\n_Our anguish_ has been _undescribable_. We have been _thirty-six hours\nwithout any news_, not knowing even if my parents and the family were\nstill alive or not, and what had been their fate. Death is not worse\nthan what we endured during these horrible hours. We don't know yet\nwhat to think, what to believe, I would almost say, what to wish; we\nare _stunned_ and _crushed_ by the awful blow. What has happened is\n_unaccountable, incomprehensible_; it appears to us like a _fearful_\ndream. Alas! I fear my dear beloved father was led away by his\n_extreme courage_; by that same courage which had made his success and\na part of his strength; for it is strange to say that even those that\ndeplored most his resolution never to yield on certain things gave him\ncredit for it. The exaggeration of the system of peace and resistance,\nor rather _immobility_, lost him, as that of war lost Napoleon. Had he\nshunned less war _on all occasions_, and granted in time some trifling\nreforms, he would have satisfied public opinion, and would probably\nbe still where he was _only eight days ago_, strong, beloved, and\nrespected! Guizot's accession has been _as fatal_ as his fall, and\nis perhaps the _first cause_ of our ruin, though my father cannot be\nblamed for having kept him in office, as he had the majority in the\nChamber, and an overwhelming one. _Constitutionally_, he could not\nhave been turned out, and it was _impossible to foresee_ that when\nall was quiet, the country prosperous and happy, the laws and\nliberty respected, the Government strong, a _Revolution_--and _such\na Revolution_--would be brought on by a few imprudent words, and the\nresistance (lamentable as it was) to a manifestation which, in fact,\nthe Government had a right to prevent. _It was the Almighty's will:\nwe must submit._ He had decreed our loss the day He removed my beloved\nbrother from this world. Had he lived still, all this would\nhave turned otherwise. It has been also an immense misfortune that\nJoinville and Aumale were both away. They were both popular (which\npoor dear _never-to-be-sufficiently-respected_ Nemours was _not_),\nenergetic, courageous, and capable of turning chance in our favour.\nOh! _how I long_ to know what is become of them! I cannot live till\nthen, and the thought of my unfortunate parents _annihilates_ me! Poor\ndear Joinville had foreseen and foretold almost all that has happened,\nand it was the idea of the crisis he apprehended which made him so\nunhappy to go. He repeated it to me several times six weeks ago. Alas!\n_nobody_ would believe him, and who _could believe_ that in _a day_,\nalmost without struggle, _all would be over_, and the past, the\npresent, the future carried away on an unaccountable storm! _God's\nwill be done!_ He was at least _merciful_ to my dear Aunt, and I hope\nHe will preserve all those dear to me!\nHere everything is quiet: the horror general, and the best feeling\nand spirit prevailing. There is still now nothing to fear: but if _a\nrepublic really established_ itself in France, it is impossible to\ntell what may happen. For this reason your Uncle thinks it right that\nwe should remove to some place of safety what we have of precious.\nIf you permit I will avail myself of the various messengers that are\ngoing now to send _under your care_ several boxes, which you will\nkindly send to Claremont to Moor, to keep with those your Uncle\nalready sent. They contain your Uncle's letters and those of my\nparents--the treasure I most value in the world.\n_29th._--MY DEARLY BELOVED VICTORIA,--This was written yesterday, in\na moment of comparative quiet, when I thought my parents at least safe\nand in security in England. Albert's letter to your Uncle of the 27th,\nwhich arrived yesterday evening, says they were _not arrived yet_, and\nI am again in the most horrible agony. I had also yesterday evening\ndetails of their flight (_my father flying!!!_) by Madame de Murat,\nVictoire's lady, who has gone to England, which quite distracted me.\nThank God that Nemours and Cl\u00e9m at least _are safe!_I am quite unable\nto say more, and I hope the Duchess and Alexandrine will excuse me if\nI don't write to them. Truly, I _can't_. I thank you only once more,\nmy beloved Victoria, _for all your kindness_ and _interest_ for my\nunfortunate family, and trust all the anxiety you feel for us won't\nhurt you. God bless you ever, with all those dear to you. Believe me\nalways, my beloved Victoria, yours most devotedly,\nLOUISE.\nI send you no letter for my mother in the present uncertainty.",

    "body": "MY DEAR LORD PALMERSTON,--It was a hair-trigger affair altogether, but\nthanks be to God everything has gone off admirably. I was obliged\nto abandon the plan of trusting the King in a fishing-boat from\nTrouville. The weather was very stormy; had he attempted to find the\nsteamer, he might have failed, for the sea was in a furious state and\nthe wind ahead. There was also the danger of the fishing-boat being\nlost, a contingency the very idea of which made me miserable.\nI therefore abandoned the plan altogether, and after much and careful\nreflection determined to execute one more within my control, and the\nboldness of which, though trying to the nerves, was its very essence\nfor success. It was to bring the King and Queen into Havre itself\nbefore anybody could suspect such a dangerous intention, and have\neverything ready for their embarkation to a minute. To carry out the\nplan, I wanted vigilant, intelligent, and firm agents, and I found\nthem as it turned out. It was known to me that the lower classes\nsuspected it was M. Guizot concealed at Trouville, and as some\nsinister occurrence might reasonably be expected there, I sent a\nfaithful person into Calvados. It was high time. The mob had assembled\nat the place where the King was, who had to slip out at the back door\nand walk two leagues on foot. At length he reached a small cottage\nbelonging to a gardener at Honfleur, where the Queen was. This was\nhalf-past six o'clock A.M. yesterday. My agent saw the King and Queen,\nwho, after some conversation, sent him back with this message, that\nthey \"would wait where they were until they again heard from me, and\nwould carry out my final arrangements with exactitude, as far as it\ndepended upon them.\" I now instructed Captain Paul to be ready at\nhalf-past seven P.M., when it would be dark, to have his water hot,\nready to get up steam; to have only a rope moored to the quay with an\nanchor astern; to expect me with a party a little before eight P.M.,\nand as soon as I had got on board with my party and told him to push\noff, he was to let me go on shore, cut his rope and cable, get into\nthe middle of the Basin, up with his steam and jib and push for\nEngland. Not a word was to be spoken on board.\nTo get the King here from Honfleur the following method was adopted:\nM. Bresson, a loyal and intelligent officer in the French Navy and\nwell known to the King, and Mr Jones, my Vice-Consul and principal\nClerk, went in the steam ferry-boat a quarter before five P.M. to\nHonfleur. From the landing-place it is three-quarters of a mile to the\nplace where the King and Queen were concealed. The ferry-boat was to\nleave Honfleur for Havre a quarter before seven o'clock. I had given\nM. Bresson a passport for Mr and Mrs Smith, and with this passport the\nKing was to walk to the landing-place, where he was to be met by my\nVice-Consul and be governed by him.\nIf the _gens d'armes_ disputed his passport Mr Jones was to vouch for\nits regularity, and say that he was sent by me to conduct Mr Smith to\nHavre, who was my Uncle. M. Bresson was to follow with the Queen,\nand the rest of the suite were to come to the ferry-boat one after\nanother, but none of the party were to know each other. The ferry-boat\nwas to arrive in Havre about half-past seven, and I was to do the\nrest. A white pocket-handkerchief was to be twice exhibited as a\nsignal that all was right so far. The difficulty of the _gens d'armes_\nbeing infinitely more to be provided against and apprehended here, I\nfirst confidentially communicated to the greatest gossips in the town\nthat I had seen a written statement from an official person that the\nKing had reached England in a fishing-boat from the neighbourhood of\nTr\u00e9port, and then got some persons whom I could rely upon, sons of my\ntradesmen here who are in the National Guard, to be near the steamer\nthat was to receive the King, to give me their assistance if it should\nbe necessary, on account of the turbulence of the crowd, to\nembark some friends of mine who were going to England. And if an\nextraordinary number of _gens d'armes_ were stationed at the steamer,\nand they hesitated about letting my Uncle go on board, then about one\nhundred yards off I had two persons who were to pretend a quarrel and\na fight, to which I knew the _gens d'armes_ would all go as well as\nthe crowd. In the meantime I hoped that as Captain Paul made no noise\nwith his steam that the crowd would not assemble, and that we might\nfind no _gens d'armes_. The anxiously expected moment at length\narrived. The ferry-boat steamer came to the quay; it was almost dark,\nbut I saw the white pocket-handkerchief. There was a great number of\npassengers, which favoured the debarkation. When half of them were\nout, the trembling Queen came up the ladder. I took her hand, told her\nit was me, and M. Bresson walked with her towards our steamer. At last\ncame the King, disguised, his whiskers shaved off, a sort of casquette\non his head, and a coarse overcoat, and immense goggles over his eyes.\nNot being able to see well, he stumbled, when I advanced, took his\nhand and said, \"Ah, dear Uncle, I am delighted to see you.\" Upon which\nhe answered, \"My dear George, I am glad you are here.\" The English\nabout me now opened the crowd for their Consul, and I moved off to a\nquiet and shaded part of the quay. But my dear Uncle talked so loud\nand so much that I had the greatest difficulty to make him keep\nsilence. At length we reached the steamer; it was like a clock-work\nmovement. The crowd was again opened for me. I conducted the King to\na state-room below, gave him some information, and having personally\nascertained that the Queen was in her cabin, and being very\nmuch touched with her tears and her grateful acknowledgments, I\nrespectfully took my leave, gave the Captain the word to cut loose,\nand scrambled ashore. In twenty minutes the steamer was outside,\nsteaming away for England. I drove down to the jetty, and had that\nlast satisfaction of seeing her beyond all possibility of recall, and\nthen drove home. Much has been said this morning about the mysterious\ndeparture of Captain Paul, and I have been obliged to confess that the\ngentleman I was seen conducting on board was a brother of the King\nof Naples, who was immensely frightened without cause, and that I had\nengaged the steamer for him and his family. Many think, however, that\nit was the King, but then again that could not be if he crossed over\nfrom Tr\u00e9port in a fishing-boat. We have got everybody completely\nmystified, and there are only four persons in the secret, who will all\nremain in the same story.\nI have scribbled, amidst the most hurried engagements, this little\nnarrative, believing that it would interest your Lordship. It has the\ninterest of romance and the support of truth. I have the honour to be,\netc.\nG. W. FEATHERSTONHAUGH.\nInformation has just reached me that one hour after the King and Queen\nleft their hiding-place last night, and just when I was embarking\nthem, an officer and three _gens d'armes_ came to the place to arrest\nhim. They were sent by the new Republican _Pr\u00e9fet_. It appears that\nthe man who gave him refuge had confessed who he was as soon as the\nKing had left Trouville, and had betrayed the King's hiding-place at\nHonfleur. What an escape! Your Lordship will see a paragraph in the\nenclosed newspaper not altogether false. We in the secret know nothing\nabout Louis Philippe; we know something about the Count of Syracuse\nand something about Mr William Smith. If it leaks out, it must come\nfrom England. Here no one has any proof. In the meantime almost\neverybody here is delighted to think that he may have escaped.",

    "body": "Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\nto state that General Dumas has just been with him to announce that\nthe King and Queen of the French landed this morning at Newhaven,\nhaving been brought over in the Steam Packet Express, in which they\nembarked at Havre yesterday evening about eight o'clock.\nGeneral Dumas says that till the morning of their arrival at Dreux the\nKing and the Queen imagined that the Comte de Paris had succeeded to\nthe Throne, and that the Duchess of Orleans had been declared Regent;\nthat when they heard that a Republic and a Provisional Government had\nbeen declared they thought it unsafe to remain at Dreux; and that they\nthen separated in order to go by different roads to Honfleur, where\nthey were to meet at a small house belonging to a friend of\nGeneral Dumas. At that house they remained for some days, until Mr\nFeatherstonhaugh opened a communication with them. The King then\nremoved to Trouville in order to embark from thence in a manner which\nMr Featherstonhaugh had arranged, and he remained there two or three\ndays for that purpose; but the weather was too stormy, and prevented\nhis departure. In the meanwhile the people of Trouville found out who\nhe was, and their demonstrations of attachment became inconvenient.\nHe therefore returned to Honfleur, and the arrangements were altered.\nYesterday evening at seven o'clock the King, the Queen, and General\nDumas came to the ferry-boat which plies between Honfleur and Havre,\nand were met by the Vice-Consul, who treated the King as uncle of\nthe Consul. On landing at Havre the King walked straight down to the\nExpress Packet, which was lying ready; the Queen went separately,\nand after making a slight round through the streets of Havre embarked\nalso; the Packet then immediately started, and went into Newhaven in\npreference to any other port, because no Packets start from thence\nfor the French coast. General Dumas says that the whole party were\nunprovided with anything but the clothes they wore, and he was going\nto the King's banker to provide funds to enable him to come to town,\nand said that the King begged him to apologise for his not having\nat once written to your Majesty to thank your Majesty for the great\ninterest which your Majesty has taken in his safety, and for the\nassistance, which he has received for his escape, but that he would do\nso this evening.\nGeneral Dumas said that the King's present intention is to remain in\nEngland in the strictest _incognito_, and that he and the Queen will\nassume the title of Count and Countess of Neuilly.\nViscount Palmerston explained to General Dumas that your Majesty has\nmade arrangements for the King's reception at Claremont, and that your\nMajesty intended to send down an officer of your Majesty's Household\nto communicate with the King.\nGeneral Dumas said that the King would most gratefully avail himself\nof the arrangement as to Claremont, but that under all circumstances,\nand as the King wished to remain in entire privacy, he thought it\nwould be better that no person from your Majesty's Household should\ngo down to the King at Newhaven, and that he was sure the King would\nrather find his own way from the railway station at London Bridge to\nClaremont than attract attention by being met at the station by any of\nyour Majesty's carriages.\nThe King would remain to-night at Newhaven, and would come up\nto-morrow morning. General Dumas said that the King and the Queen had\ngone through much personal fatigue and mental anxiety, but are both\nwell in health. The General was going to Count Jarnac before he\nreturned to Newhaven.",

Ought\nnot Montpensier at least to have gone to Vincennes? I know Cl\u00e9m even\nthinks this--as also that _one_ ought to have foreseen, and ought to\nhave managed things better. Certainly at the _very last_, if they had\nnot gone, they would all have been massacred; and _I_ think they were\nquite right, and in short could not avoid going as quickly as they\ncould; but there is an impression they _fled_ too quickly. Still the\nrecollection of Louis XVI.... is enough to justify all, and everybody\nwill admit that; but the Princes, they think, ought to have remained.\n_What_ do _you_ think of all this? I think the blunders were _all_ on\nthe last three or four days--and on the last day, but were no longer\nto be avoided at last; there seemed a _fatality_, and _all_ was lost.\nPoor Nemours did his best till he could _no longer_ get to the troops.\nPeople here also abuse him for letting Victoire go alone--but he\n_remained_ to do his _duty_; a little more _empressement_ on her\narrival here I would have wished. Albert told you all about the\nMontpensiers' journey. It would do the King irreparable mischief if\nthey went now to Spain; the feeling of anger would all return.

I have enquired a\ngood deal into the state of employment about London, and I find, to\nmy great regret, that the number of workmen of all trades out of\nemployment is _very_ large, and that it has been increased by the\nreduction of all the works under Government, owing to the clamour for\neconomy in the House of Commons. Several hundred workmen have been\ndischarged at Westminster Palace; at Buckingham Palace much fewer\nhands are employed than are really wanted; the formation of Battersea\nPark has been suspended, etc., etc. Surely this is not the moment for\nthe tax-payers to economise upon the working classes!

    "body": "The Queen had not time the other day to talk to Lord John Russell on\nthe subject of the French Royal Family, and therefore writes to him\nnow. As it seems now most probable that they, or at least some of\nthem, will take up their residence for a lengthened period in this\ncountry, and as their position is now a defined one, viz. that of\n_exiles_, their treatment should be defined and established.\nAt first everything seemed temporary, and the public were much\noccupied with them, inclined to criticise all that was done or was\nomitted by the Court; all their movements were recorded in the papers,\netc. The lapse of three months has a good deal altered this. They have\nlived in complete retirement, and are comparatively forgotten; and\ntheir poverty and their resignation to their misfortunes have met with\nmuch sympathy! The Queen is consequently anxious to take the right\nline; particularly desirous to do nothing which could hurt the\ninterests of the country, and equally so to do everything kind towards\na distinguished Royal Family in severe affliction, with whom she\nhas long been on terms of intimacy, and to whom she is very nearly\nrelated. She accordingly wishes to know if Lord John sees any\nobjection to the following: She has asked her Cousin, the Duchess of\nNemours, to come for two or three nights to see her at Osborne when\nshe goes there, _quite_ privately; the Duchess of Kent would bring her\nwith her. The Duke will not come with the Duchess, as he says he feels\n(very properly) it would be unbecoming in him till their fate (as to\n_fortune_, for _banished_ they already are) is decided, to be even\nfor a day at Osborne. The Duchess herself wishes not to appear in the\nevening, but to remain alone with the Queen and the Prince.\nThe Queen considers that when she is _staying_ in the country during\nthe summer and autumn, and any of the branches of the French Royal\nFamily should wish to visit her and the Prince, as they occasionally\ndo here, she might lodge them for one or two nights, as the distance\nmight be too great for their returning the same day. They are exiles,\nand _not Pretenders_, as the Duc de Bordeaux and Count de Montemolin\nare (and who are _for that reason only not received at Court_). In all\ncountries where illustrious exiles related to the Sovereign have been\nthey have always been received at Court, as the Duc de Bordeaux, the\nDuchesse d'Angoul\u00eame, etc., etc., invariably have been at Vienna (even\non public occasions), there being a French Ambassador there, and the\nbest understanding existing between France and Austria. The Duke of\nOrleans (King Louis Philippe) in former times was constantly received\nby the Royal Family, and was the intimate friend of the Duke of Kent.\nProbably, if their fortunes are restored to them, the French Royal\nFamily will go out into society in the course of time, and if the\nstate of France becomes consolidated there may no longer exist that\nwish and that necessity for _extreme_ privacy, which is so obvious\nnow. What the Queen has just mentioned, Lord John must well\nunderstand, is not what is _likely_ to take place (except in the case\nof her cousin, the Duchess of Nemours) immediately, but only what\nmight occasionally occur when we are permanently settled in the\ncountry. Of course events _might_ arise which would change this,\nand which would render it inadvisable, and then the Queen would\ncommunicate with Lord John, and ask his advice again upon the subject.\nAll she has suggested refers to the present state of affairs, and,\nof course, merely to _strictly_ private visits, and on _no state\noccasion_. This is a long letter about such a subject, but the Queen\nwishes to be quite safe in what she does, and therefore could not have\nstated the case and her opinion in a smaller space.",

The Archduke John has spoken\nvery reassuringly both to Ernest and the Duke of Meiningen, and the\nattachment in many of those smaller principalities is still extremely\ngreat, and I am sure they will never consent to being _ausgewischt_.\nCoburg, for instance, on the occasion of the suppression of a very\nsmall riot, showed the greatest attachment and devotion to Ernest; at\nGotha the feeling of independence is _very_ great, and at Strelitz, on\nthe occasion of Augusta's confinement with a _son_, the enthusiasm and\nrejoicing was universal. All this cannot be entirely despised.\nWe are as happy as possible here, and would be perfectly so, if it was\nnot for the sorrow and misfortunes of so many dear to us, and for the\nstate of the world in general.\nI have always forgotten to tell you that we bought a fine marble bust\nof you quite by accident in London the other day.

It is indeed to me one of eternal thankfulness, for a purer,\nmore perfect being than my beloved Albert the Creator could _not_ have\nsent into this troubled world. I feel that I could _not_ exist without\nhim, and that I should sink under the troubles and annoyances and\n_d\u00e9go\u00fbts_ of my _very_ difficult position, were it not for _his_\nassistance, protection, guidance, and comfort. Truly do I thank you\nfor your _great_ share in bringing about our marriage.\nStockmar I do not quite understand, and I cannot believe that he\n_really wishes to ruin_ all the smaller States, though his principal\nobject is that unity which I fear he will _not_ obtain.\nI do not either at all agree in his wish that Prussia should take the\nlead; his love for Prussia is to me incomprehensible, for it is the\ncountry of all others which the _rest_ of Germany dislikes. Stockmar\ncannot be my good old friend if he has such notions of injustice as\nI hear attributed to him. But whatever they may be, I do _not_ believe\nthe _Ausf\u00fchrung_ to be possible.\nI have great hopes of soon hearing of something decided about the\nfortunes of the poor French family. You will have seen how nobly and\ncourageously good Joinville and Aumale behaved on the occasion of the\nburning of that emigrant ship off Liverpool. It will do them great\ngood. I must now conclude.

The climate is also dry,\nand in general not very cold, though we had one or two very cold days.\nThere is a deer forest--many roe deer, and on the opposite hill (which\ndoes not belong to us) grouse. There is also black cock and ptarmigan.\nAlbert has, however, no luck this year, and has in vain been after the\ndeer, though they are continually seen, and often quite close by the\nhouse.

Lord John replied that he was\naware of it; that he had considered the matter already, having heard\nfrom his brother (the Duke of Bedford) how strongly I felt about it;\nthat he felt the truth of all that I had said, but that, on the other\nhand, Lord Palmerston was a very able man, entirely master of his\noffice and affairs, and a very good colleague, never making any\ndifficulties about other questions, but (certainly _unreasonably_)\ncomplaining of other people mixing with and interfering in the affairs\nof his office. I said that ... I fully believed that that Spanish\nmarriage question, which had been the original cause of so many\npresent misfortunes, would never have become so _embrouill\u00e9_ had it\nnot been for Lord Palmerston. This led Lord John to say, that though\nhe disapproved the length of Lord Palmerston's correspondence, still\nthat we could not have done otherwise than object to the marriage.\nThis is true enough. I repeated that all that had been done in Italy\nlast winter had also done harm, as it was done by _Lord Palmerston_,\nwho was distrusted everywhere abroad, which Lord John regretted. I\nsaid that I thought that he often endangered the honour of England by\ntaking a very prejudiced and one-sided view of a question;... that his\nwritings were always as bitter as gall and did great harm, which\nLord John entirely assented to, and that I often felt quite ill from\nanxiety; that I wished Lord Clarendon (who, I had heard, was tired\nof Ireland) could come over and be Secretary of State for Foreign\nAffairs, and Lord Palmerston go to Ireland as Lord-Lieutenant. Lord\nJohn said nothing would be better, for that he was sure that Lord\nPalmerston would make an admirable Lord-Lieutenant, but that another\nthing to be considered was the danger of making Lord Palmerston an\nenemy by displacing him, that Lord Minto (who was formerly a great\nfriend and admirer of Lord Palmerston's) had told Lady John when she\nspoke to him on the subject of placing Lord Palmerston in another\noffice, that _he_ (Lord Palmerston) would certainly turn against the\nGovernment if displaced. I said that might be, but that sometimes\nthere were great interests at stake which exceeded the danger of\noffending one man, and that this was here the case; Lord John said\nit was very true, but that at moments like these one of course was\nanxious not to do anything which could cause internal trouble.\nI admitted this, but repeated my anxiety, which Lord John quite\nunderstood, though he thought I a little overrated it, and said I was\nafraid that some day I should have to tell Lord John that I could\nnot put up with Lord Palmerston any longer, which might be very\ndisagreeable and awkward.\nIt ended by Lord John's promising to bear the subject in mind, and I\nmust say that he took it all just as I could wish.\nVICTORIA R.",

The partiality of Lord Palmerston in\nthis Italian question really _surpasses all conception_, and makes the\nQueen _very uneasy_ on account of the character and honour of England,\nand on account of the danger to which the peace of Europe will be\nexposed. It is now clearly proved by Baron Wessenberg that upon the\nconclusion of the Armistice with Sardinia, negotiations for peace\nwould have speedily been entered into, had our _mediation_ not been\noffered to the King, to whom the offer of Lombardy was too tempting\nnot to accept, and now that promise is by fair or unfair means to\nbe made good. The Queen cannot see any principle in this, as the\nprinciple upon which Lord Palmerston goes is _Italian Nationality and\nIndependence from a foreign Yoke and Tyranny_. How can the Venetian\nterritory then be secured to Austria? and if this is done, on what\nground can Lombardy be wrung from her? It is really not safe to settle\nsuch important matters without principle and by personal _passion_\nalone. When the _French_ Government say they cannot control public\nfeeling, Lord Palmerston takes this as an unalterable fact, and as\na sufficient reason to make the Austrians give up Lombardy; when,\nhowever, the _Austrian_ Government say they cannot give up Lombardy on\naccount of the feeling of the Army which had just reconquered it\nwith their blood and under severe privations and sufferings, Lord\nPalmerston flippantly tells the Austrian Government, \"if that were so,\nthe Emperor had better abdicate and make General Radetzky Emperor.\"\nWhen Charles Albert burned the whole of the suburbs of Milan to keep\nup the delusion that he meant to defend the town, Lord Palmerston\nsaid nothing; and now that the Austrian Governor has prohibited\nrevolutionary placards on the walls, and prolonged the period at which\narms are to be surrendered, at the end of which persons concealing\narms are to be tried by court-martial, he writes to Vienna: \"that this\nsavage proclamation, which savours more of the barbarous usages of\ncenturies long gone by than of the spirit of the present times,\nmust strike everybody as a proof of the fear by which the Austrian\nCommander is inspired,\" etc., etc., etc.\nVenice was to have been made over to Austria by the Armistice, and\nnow that this has not been done, Austria is not even to retake it, in\norder (as Lord Normanby says) to keep something in hand against which\nAustria is to make further concessions. Is all this fair? In the\nmeantime, from the account of our Consul at Venice, the French agents\nare actively employed in intrigues against Austria in that town, and\nhave asked him to assist, which he refused. Lord Palmerston merely\napproved his conduct, and did not write a line to Paris about it. Now\nthe question at issue is not even to be submitted to a Conference of\nEuropean powers, but to be settled by the French Republic and Lord\nPalmerston alone, Lord Normanby being the instrument who has pledged\nhimself over and over again for Italian _independence_ (so called).\nIf Austria makes peace with Sardinia, and gives her Italian provinces\nseparate National Institutions with a liberal constitutional\nGovernment, _who can force_ upon her another arrangement?",

The Queen is sure Lord John will feel that neither\nLord Palmerston nor Lord Normanby have shown a proper regard for the\nQueen's wishes and opinion in this matter. Lord Normanby's Despatch\nshows that the step to be taken with reference to an Ambassador to be\nsent here is avowedly for the purpose of controlling the future action\nof the Queen's Government, and to _oblige her_ to keep a _permanent_\nAmbassador at Paris in the person of Lord Normanby. It is not very\ndelicate in Lord Normanby to convey such a message, nor in Lord\nPalmerston to urge it so eagerly. M. de Beaumont's departure from this\ncountry without taking leave of the Queen was neither very becoming.\nThe Queen has already, on Lord Palmerston's account, received two\npublic affronts: the one by her Minister in Spain having been sent out\nof that country, the other now, by the new Emperor of Austria\nnot announcing to her by special mission his accession to the Throne,\nwhich he did to all other Sovereigns, avowedly, as it appears, to mark\nthe indignation of Austria at the inimical proceedings of the British\nForeign Secretary. The Queen does not think that, in the face of such\nslurs, the dignity of England will be vindicated by a race between her\nrepresentative and that of Spain, who is to present his credentials\nfirst to the new President of the French Republic, which Lord\nPalmerston considers of such importance as to render an _immediate_\ndecision indispensable.\nShould Lord John think that we cannot do less now for Louis Napoleon\nthan has been done in the case of General Cavaignac, the Queen\nwill not object to renewing Lord Normanby's credentials as\nAmbassador-Extraordinary on a special mission.",

But he is so satisfied of the\nextreme pleasure which your Majesty would experience on learning that\nthe prisoners who were in the hands of the Sikhs, and especially the\nladies and children, were once again safe in the British camp, that he\nwould have ventured to convey to your Majesty that intelligence,\neven though he had not been able to add to it--as happily he can--the\nannouncement of the surrender of the whole Khalsa army, and the end of\nthe war with the Sikhs.\nMajor-General Gilbert pushed on rapidly in pursuit of the Sikhs, who\nwere a few marches in front of him, carrying off our prisoners with\nthem.\nAt Rawul Pindee, half-way between the Jhelum and Attock, the Sikh\ntroops, as we have since heard, would go no further. They received no\npay, they were starving, they had been beaten and were disheartened;\nand so they surrendered.\nAll the prisoners were brought safe into our camp. Forty-one pieces of\nartillery were given up. Chuttur Singh and Shere Singh, with all the\nSirdars, delivered their swords to General Gilbert in the presence of\nhis officers; and the remains of the Sikh army, 16,000 strong, were\nmarched into camp, by 1000 at a time, and laid down their arms as they\npassed between the lines of the British troops.\nYour Majesty may well imagine the pride with which British Officers\nlooked on such a scene, and witnessed this absolute subjection and\nhumiliation of so powerful an enemy.\nHow deeply the humiliation was felt by the Sikhs themselves may be\njudged by the report which the officers who were present have made,\nthat many of them, and especially the grim old Khalsas of Runjeet's\ntime, exclaimed as they threw their arms down upon the heap: \"This day\nRunjeet Singh has died!\"\nUpwards of 20,000 stands of arms were taken in the hills. Vast\nquantities were gathered after the flight of the Sikhs from Gujerat.\nAs a further precaution, the Governor-General has ordered a disarming\nof the Sikhs throughout the Eastern Doabs, while they are yet cast\ndown and afraid of punishment. He trusts that these measures may all\ntend to ensure the continuance of peace.\nThe Sirdars will arrive at Lahore to-day, where they will await the\ndetermination of their future places of residence. The officers who\nwere prisoners have also reached Lahore, together with Mrs George\nLawrence and her children.\nIt is impossible to speak too highly of the admirable spirit which\nthis lady has displayed during many months of very arduous trial.\nBy the kindness of others, the Governor-General has had the\nopportunity of seeing constantly the little notes which were secretly\ndespatched by her from her prison. The gallant heart she kept up under\nit all, the cheerful face she put upon it, and the unrepining patience\nwith which she bore the privations of captivity and the dangers which\nit threatened to her children, her husband, and herself, must command\nthe highest respect and make one proud of one's countrywomen.\nGeneral Gilbert, by the latest intelligence, had seized the fort of\nAttock, had crossed the Indus, and was advancing on Peshawur, whither\nthe Afghans had retired.\nBy next mail the Governor-General trusts that he will be able to\nannounce that every enemy has been swept away by your Majesty's\nArmies, and that the Afghans have either been crushed like the Sikhs\nor have fled to Cabul again.\nHe has the honour to subscribe himself, your Majesty's most obedient,\nmost humble and very faithful Subject and Servant,\nDALHOUSIE.",

To defend Holstein against the attack made by Denmark\nupon this union, Germany joined the war. It is true that it is\nnow proposed in the new Constitution for Germany to consent to the\nseparation of Schleswig and Holstein, although last year the Frankfort\nParliament had desired the incorporation of Schleswig into Germany\nwith Holstein; but the question for Germany is now not to begin a war,\nbut to close one by a lasting peace. In this she has, in the Queen's\nopinion, a right and a duty to see that the independence of Schleswig\nis secured before she abandons that country. The comparison with\nSaxony does not hold good for a moment, for the Schleswig Revolution\nwas not directed against the Duke, but against the King of Denmark,\nwho invaded the rights of the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein; the\nassistance of Prussia could therefore not be given to Denmark, but to\nSchleswig-Holstein. The case of Hungary has neither any similitude.\nHungary is not to be torn from its connection with the German States\nby the Austrian Government, but just the reverse.\nLord Palmerston cannot be more anxious for a speedy termination of the\nDanish war than the Queen is, but she thinks that the mediation will\nnot effect this as long as the mediating power merely watches which\nof the two parties is in the greatest difficulties for the moment, and\nurges it to give way; but by a careful and anxious discovery of the\nrights of the question and a steady adherence to the recommendation\nthat what is right and fair ought to be done. The cause of the\nwar having been the unlawful attempt to incorporate Schleswig into\nDenmark, the peace cannot be lasting unless it contains sufficient\nguarantees against the resumption of that scheme.",

By my letter to Louise you will have\nheard of our arrival in the Cove of Cork. Our visit to Cork was very\nsuccessful; the Mayor was knighted _on deck_ (on board the _Fairy_),\nlike in times of old. Cork is about seventeen miles up the River Lee,\nwhich is beautifully wooded and reminds us of Devonshire scenery. We\nhad previously stepped on shore at _Cove_, a small place, to enable\nthem to call it _Queen's Town_; the enthusiasm is immense, and at Cork\nthere was more firing than I remember since the Rhine.\nWe left Cork with fair weather, but a head sea and contrary wind which\nmade it rough and me very sick.\n_7th._--I was unable to continue till now, and have since received\nyour kind letter, for which I return my warmest thanks. We went into\nWaterford Harbour on Saturday afternoon, which is likewise a fine,\nlarge, safe harbour. Albert went up to Waterford in the _Fairy_, but\nI did not. The next morning we received much the same report of the\nweather which we had done at Cork, viz. that the weather was fair but\nthe wind contrary. However we went out, as it could not be helped,\nand we might have remained there some days for no use. The first three\nhours were very nasty, but afterwards it cleared and the evening was\nbeautiful. The entrance at seven o'clock into Kingston Harbour was\nsplendid; we came in with ten steamers, and the whole harbour,\nwharf, and every surrounding place was _covered_ with _thousands_ and\nthousands of people, who received us with the greatest enthusiasm. We\ndisembarked yesterday morning at ten o'clock, and took two hours\nto come here. The most perfect order was maintained in spite of the\nimmense mass of people assembled, and a more good-humoured crowd I\nnever saw, but noisy and excitable beyond belief, talking, jumping,\nand shrieking instead of cheering. There were numbers of troops out,\nand it really was a wonderful scene. This is a very pretty place,\nand the house reminds me of dear Claremont. The view of the Wicklow\nMountains from the windows is very beautiful, and the whole park is\nvery extensive and full of very fine trees.\nWe drove out yesterday afternoon and were followed by jaunting-cars\nand riders and people running and screaming, which would have amused\nyou. In the evening we had a dinner party, and so we have to-night.\nThis morning we visited the Bank, the Model School (where the\nProtestant and Catholic Archbishops received us), and the College, and\nthis afternoon we went to the Military Hospital. To-morrow we have a\nLev\u00e9e, where 1,700 are to be presented, and the next day a Review, and\nin the evening the Drawing-Room, when 900 ladies are to be presented.\nGeorge is here, and has a command here. He rode on one side of our\ncarriage yesterday. You see more ragged and wretched people here than\nI ever saw anywhere else. _En revanche_, the women are really very\nhandsome--quite in the lowest class--as well at Cork as here; such\nbeautiful black eyes and hair and such fine colours and teeth.\nI must now take my leave.

All the precedents being in accordance with\nthe proposition made by the Duke, an opposition on the part of the\nGovernment would imply a declaration against all brevets except in the\nfield, which would deprive the Crown of a most valuable prerogative.\nIf such a brevet as the one proposed were to lead to great additional\nexpense, the Queen could understand the objection on the ground of\neconomy; but the giving brevet rank to a few subaltern officers is too\ntrifling a matter to alarm the Government. Perhaps the number might be\nreduced even, but to deviate from the established precedents for\nthe first time altogether in this case, and that after the excellent\nbehaviour of the Army in Ireland under very trying circumstances,\nwould be felt as a great injustice.\nThe Queen therefore wishes Lord John to ask the Duke to send him\nthe former precedents and to consider with his colleagues whether a\nmodified recommendation cannot be laid before her.",

    "body": "Before leaving Town yesterday we saw Lord John Russell, who came to\nstate what had passed with reference to Lord Palmerston. He premised\nthat Lord Palmerston had at all times been a most agreeable and\naccommodating colleague; that he had acted with Lord John ever since\n1831, and had not only never made any difficulty, but acted most\nboldly and in the most spirited manner on all political questions;\nbesides, he was very popular with the Radical part of the House of\nCommons as well as with the Protectionist, so that both would be ready\nto receive him as their Leader; he (Lord John) was therefore most\nanxious to do nothing which could hurt Lord Palmerston's feelings, nor\nto bring about a disruption of the Whig Party, which at this moment\nof Party confusion was the only one which still held together. On the\nother hand, the fact that the Queen distrusted Lord Palmerston was a\nserious impediment to the carrying on of the Government. Lord John was\ntherefore anxious to adopt a plan by which Lord Palmerston's services\ncould be retained with his own goodwill, and the Foreign Affairs\nentrusted to other hands. The only plan he could think of was to give\nLord Palmerston the lead in the House of Commons--the highest position\na statesman could aspire to--and to go himself to the House of Lords.\nHe had communicated his views to Lord Lansdowne, who agreed in them,\nand thought he could do nothing better than speak to Lord Palmerston\nat once. Lord Palmerston said that he could not have helped to have\nbecome aware that he had forfeited the Queen's confidence, but he\nthought this had not been on _personal_ grounds, but merely on account\nof his line of policy, with which the Queen disagreed. (The Queen\ninterrupted Lord John by remarking that she distrusted him on\n_personal_ grounds also, but I remarked that Lord Palmerston had so\nfar at least seen rightly; that he had become disagreeable to the\nQueen, not on account of his person, but of his political doings,\nto which the Queen assented.) Lord Palmerston appeared to Lord John\nwilling to enter into this agreement.\nOn the question how the Foreign Office should be filled, Lord John\nsaid that he thought his father-in-law, Lord Minto, ought to take\nthe Foreign Office.... As the Queen was somewhat startled by this\nannouncement, I said I thought that would not go down with the public.\nAfter Lord Palmerston's removal (who was considered one of the ablest\nmen in the country) he ought not to be replaced but by an equally able\nstatesman; the Office was of _enormous_ importance, and ought not to\nbe entrusted to any one but Lord John himself or Lord Clarendon. On\nthe Queen's enquiry why Lord Clarendon had not been proposed for it,\nLord John said he was most anxious that the change of the Minister\nshould not produce a change in the general line of policy which he\nconsidered to have been quite right, and that Lord Clarendon did\nnot approve of it; somehow or other he never could agree with\nLord Clarendon on Foreign Affairs; he thought Lord Clarendon very\nanti-French and for an alliance with Austria and Russia. The Queen\nreplied she knew Lord Clarendon's bad opinion of the mode in which the\nForeign Affairs had been conducted, and thought that a merit in him,\nbut did not think him Austrian or Russian, but merely disapproving\nof Lord Palmerston's behaviour. I urged Lord John to take the Foreign\nAffairs himself, which he said would have to be done if the Queen did\nnot wish Lord Minto to take them; he himself would be able to do the\nbusiness when in the House of Lords, although he would undertake it\nunwillingly; with the business in the House of Commons it would have\nbeen impossible for him.\nThe Queen insisted on his trying it with a seat in the House of Lords,\nadding that, if he found it too much for him, he could at a later\nperiod perhaps make the Department over to Lord Clarendon.\nI could not help remarking that it was a serious risk to entrust Lord\nPalmerston with the lead in the House of Commons, that it might be\nthat the Government were defeated and, if once in opposition, Lord\nPalmerston might take a different line as leader of the Opposition\nfrom that which Lord John would like, and might so easily force\nhimself back into office as Prime Minister. Lord John, however,\nalthough admitting that danger, thought Lord Palmerston too old to do\nmuch in the future (having passed his sixty-fifth year); he admitted\nthat Sir George Grey was the natural leader of the Commons, but\nexpected that a little later the lead would still fall into his hands.\nThe arrangements of the Offices as proposed would be that Lord\nPalmerston would take the Home Office, and Sir George Grey the\nColonial Office, and Lord Grey vacate this office for the Privy\nSeal. If Lord Minto, however, was not to have the Foreign Office, the\narrangement must be recast. Lord Clarendon would become Secretary\nof State for Ireland, after the abolition of the Lord-Lieutenancy.\nPossibly also Sir George Grey might take the office, and Lord\nClarendon take the Colonies, which Lord Grey would be glad to be rid\nof. On my observing that I had thought the Colonies would have done\nbest for Lord Palmerston, leaving Sir George Grey at the Home Office,\nLord John acknowledged that he would likewise prefer this arrangement,\nbut considered it rendered impossible from its having been the very\nthing Lord Grey had proposed in 1845, and upon which the attempt to\nform a Whig Government at that time had broken down, Lord Palmerston\nhaving refused to enter the Cabinet on those terms. Lord John ended\nby saying that Lord Palmerston having agreed to the change, it was\nintended that nothing should be done about it till after the close of\nthe Session, in order to avoid debates and questions on the subject;\nmoreover, Lord Lansdowne had agreed to continue still this Session his\nlabours as Leader in the House of Lords, and begged for the _utmost\nsecrecy_ at present.\nALBERT.\nLord John Russell already last year had spoken to me of his wish to\ngo to the House of Lords, finding the work in the House of Commons,\ntogether with his other business, too much for him, and Lord Lansdowne\nbeing desirous to be relieved from the lead in the Upper House.\nALBERT.",

No one can tell a day\n[ahead] what may happen in France, and if all the family have, which\nis but in France, may not be confiscated. The thirst for spoliation\nis great; the people who lead have no other view, they are not\nfanatics, their aim is to rise and to enrich themselves; the remainder\nis mere humbug, exactly as you have it very near home. Never was\nthere a nation in a worse and a more helpless state, and the numerous\nparties who will _not_ unite render all solutions impossible, and the\nrepublic will be maintained for that very reason. It is but a name\nand no substance, but that _name of_ _republic_ encourages every\nextravagant or desperate proceeding, and turns people's heads in the\nold monarchies; every doctor or magistrate sees himself president of\nsome republic, and the ambitions of so many people who see all the\nimpediments which existed formerly removed, and who, according to\ntheir _own opinion_, are wonderful people, will be insatiable and much\nmore dangerous than you imagine in England. On the Continent every man\nthinks himself fit to be at the head of the Government; there is no\npolitical measure or scale, and the success of some bookseller or\ndoctor or advocate, etc., turns the heads of all those in similar\npositions--_on ne doute de rien_. When you consider that a\n_banqueroutier_ like Ledru Rollin ruled over France _for six\nmonths_ almost with _absolute power,_ merely because he took it, you\nmay imagine how many thousands, even of workmen, cooks, stage people,\netc., look to be taken to rule over their fellow-citizens; _toujours\nconvaincu de leur propre m\u00e9rite_. I am happy to see that you escaped\na ministerial crisis; the peril was great, and it would have been\ndreadful for you at such a moment.\nAlbert made a fine long speech, I see.

I trust we may come to that\nunity of mankind of which he speaks, and of universal peace which our\nfriend Richard Cobden considers as very near at hand; if, however,\nthe red benefactors of mankind at Paris get the upper hand, _universal\nwar_ will be the order of the day.

    "body": "Lord John Russell came to-day to make his report to the Queen on\nhis final determination with respect to the Greek question and Lord\nPalmerston. He said it was quite impossible to abandon Lord Palmerston\nupon this question, that the Cabinet was as much to blame (if there\nwere cause for it) as Lord Palmerston, and particularly he himself,\nwho had given his consent to the measures taken, and was justly held\nresponsible by the country for the Foreign Policy of the Government.\nAdmitting, however, that Lord Palmerston's personal quarrels with all\nGovernments of foreign countries and the hostility with which they\nwere looking upon him was doing serious injury to the country, and\nexposing the Crown to blows aimed at the Minister, he had consulted\nLord Lansdowne.... Lord Lansdowne fully felt the strength of what I\nsaid respecting the power of the Leader of the House of Commons, and\nthe right on the part of the Queen to object to its being conferred\nupon a person who had not her entire confidence. I said I hoped Lord\nLansdowne would consider the communication of the letter as quite\nconfidential, as, although I had no objection to telling Lord\nPalmerston anything that was said in it myself, I should not like that\nit should come to his ears by third persons or be otherwise talked\nof. Lord John assured me that Lord Lansdowne could be entirely relied\nupon, and that he himself had locked up the letter under key the\nmoment he had received it, and would carefully guard it.\nThe result of our conference was, that we agreed that Lord Clarendon\nwas the only member of the Government to whom the Foreign Affairs\ncould be entrusted unless Lord John were to take them himself, which\nwas much the best. Lord John objected to Lord Clarendon's intimate\nconnection with the _Times_, and the violent Austrian line of that\npaper; moreover, Lord Clarendon would be wanted to organise the new\ndepartment of Secretary of State for Ireland. The Colonial Office\nwas much the best for Lord Palmerston, and should Lord John go to the\nHouse of Lords, Sir George Grey was to lead in the Commons. Lord John\nwould take an opportunity of communicating with Lord Palmerston, but\nwished nothing should be said or done about the changes till after the\nclose of the Session.\nALBERT.",

Brunnow proposed the Protocol to me, and\nI have been in discussion with him about it. It is _he_ who has\ncommunicated it to the French Ambassador, to Reventlow, and to\nRehausen; I sent it privately several weeks ago to Westmorland, that\nhe might show it confidentially to Schleinitz, but telling Westmorland\nthat it was not a thing settled, but only a proposal by Russia, and\nthat, at all events, some part of the wording would be altered.

I have not suffered except from my head,\nwhich is still very tender, the blow having been extremely violent,\nand the brass _end_ of the stick fell on my head so as to make a\nconsiderable noise. I own it makes me nervous out driving, and I start\nat any person coming near the carriage, which I am afraid is natural.\nWe have, alas! now another cause of much greater anxiety in the person\nof our excellent Sir Robert Peel, who, as you will see, has had\na most serious fall, and though going on well at first, was very ill\nlast night; thank God! he is better again this morning, but I fear\nstill in great danger. I cannot bear even to think of losing him; it\nwould be the greatest loss for the whole country, and irreparable for\nus, for he is so trustworthy, and so entirely to be depended on. _All_\nparties are in great anxiety about him. I will leave my letter open to\ngive you the latest news.\nOur good and amiable guest likes being with us, and will remain\nwith us till Saturday. We had a concert last night, and go to the\nopera very regularly. The _Proph\u00e8te_ is quite beautiful, and I am\nsure would delight you. The music in the _Sc\u00e8ne du Couronnement_ is,\nI think, finer than anything in either _Robert_ or the _Huguenots_; it\nis highly dramatic, and really very touching. Mario sings and acts\nin it quite in perfection. His _Raoul_ in the Huguenots is also most\nbeautiful. He improves every year, and I really think his voice is the\nfinest tenor I ever heard, and he sings and acts with such _intense_\nfeeling.\nWhat do you say to the conclusion of our debate? It leaves things just\nas they were. The House of Commons is becoming very unmanageable and\ntroublesome....\nI must now conclude. With Albert's love, ever your most affectionate\nNiece,\nVICTORIA R.\nI am happy to say that Sir Robert, though still very ill, is freer\nfrom pain, his pulse is less high, and he feels himself better; the\nDoctors think there is _no_ vital injury, and nothing from which he\ncannot recover, but that he must be for some days in a precarious\nstate.",

    "body": "Lord John Russell having lately stated that Lord Clarendon, who\nhad always been most eager to see Lord Palmerston moved, had lately\nexpressed to him his opinion that it would be most dangerous and\nimpolitic to do so under present circumstances, we thought it right\nto see Lord Clarendon here.... In conversation with me, Lord Clarendon\nspoke in his old strain of Lord Palmerston, but very strongly also\nof the danger of turning him out and making him the leader of the\nRadicals, who were anxiously waiting for that, were much dissatisfied\nwith Lord John Russell, and free from control by the death of Sir\nRobert Peel. I said that if everything was done with Lord Palmerston's\nconsent there would be no danger, to which Lord Clarendon assented,\nbut doubted that he would consent to giving up what was his hobby. He\nadded, nobody but Lord John could carry on the Foreign Affairs, but he\nought not to leave the House of Commons under present circumstances,\nwhere he was now the only authority left.\nWe saw the Duke of Bedford yesterday, whom Lord John had wished us\nto invite. He is very unhappy about the present state of affairs,\nfrightened about things going on as at present, when Lord John can\nexercise no control over Lord Palmerston, and the Queen is exposed\nyear after year to the same annoyances and dangers arising from Lord\nPalmerston's mode of conducting the affairs; but on the other hand,\nequally frightened at turning him loose. The Duke was aware of all\nthat had passed between us and Lord John, and ready to do anything\n_he_ could to bring matters to a satisfactory solution, but thought\nhis brother would not like to leave the House of Commons now. He had\nvery much changed his opinion on that head latterly, and the more so\nas he thought something ought to be done next year with the franchise,\nwhich he alone could carry through. On my questioning whether it was\nimpossible to persuade him to take the Foreign Office and stay in the\nLower House, with a first-rate under-secretary, at least for a time,\nthe Duke thought he might perhaps temporarily, as he felt he owed\nto the Queen the solution of the difficulty, but expressed again his\nfears of Lord Palmerston's opposition. I replied that if Lord John\nwould make up his mind to take the Foreign Office, and to stay in\nthe House of Commons, I saw no danger, as Lord John would be able to\nmaintain himself successfully, and Lord Palmerston would not like to\nbe in opposition to him, whilst he would become most formidable to\nanybody who was to _gain_ only the leadership in the House; moreover,\nLord John, having done so much for Lord Palmerston, could expect and\ndemand a return of sacrifice, and a variety of posts might be offered\nto him--the Presidency of the Council, the office of Home Secretary,\nor Secretary for the Colonies, Chancellor of the Exchequer, etc.,\netc., which places I was sure any member of the Cabinet would vacate\nfor him. The Duke of Bedford added the Lieutenancy of Ireland, as Lord\nClarendon had told him he was ready to give it up for the purpose, but\nonly under _one_ condition, viz. that of not having to succeed to\nLord Palmerston at the Foreign Office. Observing our surprise at\nthis declaration, the Duke added that Lord Clarendon acted most\nconsiderately, that he was ready to have no office at all, and would\nsupport the Government independently in the House of Lords if this\nwere to facilitate arrangements. The Queen rejoined that a peerage was\nof course also at Lord John's disposal for Lord Palmerston. We then\nagreed that Lord Granville would be the best person to become Lord\nJohn's Under-Secretary of State, a man highly popular, pleasing,\nconciliatory, well versed in Foreign Affairs, and most industrious;\ntrained under Lord John, he could at any time leave him the office\naltogether, if Lord John should find it too much for himself. Lord\nGranville had a higher office now, that of Vice-President of the\nBoard of Trade and Paymaster-General, but would be sure to feel the\nimportance of taking a lower office under such circumstances and with\nsuch contingencies likely to depend upon it. I have seen a great deal\nof him latterly, as he is the only working man on the Commission for\nthe Exhibition of 1851, and have found him most able, good-natured,\nand laborious. The Duke liked the proposal very much, and is going to\ncommunicate all that passed between us to Lord John on Tuesday.\nALBERT.",

    "body": "Lord John Russell came down here yesterday in order to report to the\nQueen what had passed between him and Lord Palmerston the day before,\non whom he had called in order to have an explanation on the Foreign\nAffairs.\nLord John reminded him of former communications, but admitted that\ncircumstances were much changed by the recent debates in both Houses\nof Parliament; still, it was necessary to come to an understanding of\nthe position. The _policy_ pursued with regard to the Foreign Affairs\nhad been right and such as had the approval of Lord John himself, the\nCabinet generally, and he believed the greater part of the country.\nBut the manner in which it had been executed had been unfortunate,\nled to irritation and hostility; although peace had actually been\npreserved, and England stood in a position requiring no territorial\naggrandisement or advantage of any kind, yet all Governments and\nPowers, not only Russia and Austria, but also France and the liberal\nstates, had become decidedly hostile to us, and our intercourse was\nnot such as was desirable. Lord John could instance many cases in\nwhich they had been unnecessarily slighted and provoked by Lord\nPalmerston, like M. Drouyn de Lhuys in the Greek affair. Lord\nPalmerston's conduct towards the Queen had been disrespectful and\nwanting in due attention and deference to her, and had been much\ncomplained of.\nIn consequence of all this Lord John had before proposed to Her\nMajesty that the Foreign Affairs should be entrusted to Lord Minto,\nhe himself should go to the House of Lords, and Lord Palmerston\nshould have the lead in the House of Commons. The Queen had, however,\nobjected to this arrangement, [thinking] the lead in the Lower\nHouse to be more properly given to Sir George Grey, who had as Home\nSecretary conducted all internal business in the House. Now had come\nSir R. Peel's death, which made it impossible for Lord John to leave\nthe House of Commons without endangering the position of Government\nand of the parties in the House.\nLord Palmerston was much pleased to hear of Lord John's intention to\nstay in the House of Commons, said all was changed now; there had been\na great conspiracy against him, he had been accused in Parliament, put\non his trial and acquitted. The acquittal had produced the greatest\nenthusiasm for him in the country, and he was now supported by a\nstrong party; he owned, however, that his success had been chiefly\nowing to the handsome manner in which Lord John and his colleagues had\nsupported him in the debate. That he should incur the momentary enmity\nof those states whose interests and plans he might have to cross was\nquite natural; he had never intended any disrespect to the Queen, and\nif he had been guilty of any he was quite unconscious of it and sorry\nfor it.\nLord John reminded him that although the Government had got a majority\nin the House of Commons in the Foreign debate, it was not to be\nforgotten that the fate of the Government had been staked upon it, and\nthat many people voted on that account who would not have supported\nthe Foreign policy; that it was remarkable that all those who had the\nstrongest reason to be anxious for the continuance of the Government,\nbut who could not avoid _speaking_, were obliged to speak and vote\nagainst the Government. Sir R. Peel's speech was a most remarkable\ninstance of this.\nLord Palmerston saw in Sir Robert's speech nothing but a reluctant\neffort to defend Lord Aberdeen, whom he was bound to defend. If he\n(Lord Palmerston) were to leave the Foreign Office, there must be a\nground for it, such as his having to take the lead in the House of\nCommons, which was evidently impossible with the conduct of Foreign\nDepartment at the same time. (It had killed Mr Canning, and after\nthat failure nobody ought to attempt it.) But without such a ground it\nwould be loss of character to him, which he could not be expected\nto submit to. There was not even the excuse of wishing to avoid a\ndifficulty with a foreign country, as all was smooth now. Those who\nhad wished to injure him had been beat, and now it would be\ngiving them a triumph after all. If the Queen or the Cabinet were\ndissatisfied with his management of the Foreign Affairs, they had a\nright to demand his resignation, and he would give it, but they could\nnot ask him to lower himself in public estimation. Lord John answered\nthat his resignation would lead to a further split of parties: there\nwere parties already enough in the House, and it was essential that at\nleast the Whig party should be kept together, to which Lord Palmerston\nassented. He (Lord Palmerston) then repeated his complaints against\nthat plot which had been got up in this country against him, and\nurged on by foreigners, complained particularly of Lord Clarendon, Mr\nGreville of the Privy Council, Mr Reeve, ditto, and their attacks upon\nhim in the _Times_, and of Mr Delane, the Editor of the _Times_,\nof Guizot, Princess Lieven, etc., etc., etc. However, they had been\nconvinced that they could not upset him, and Mr Reeve had declared to\nhim that he had been making open and honourable (?!!) war upon him;\nnow he would make a lasting peace. With Russia and France he (Lord\nPalmerston) had just been signing the Danish Protocol, showing that\nthey were on the best terms together.\nLord John felt he could not press the matter further under these\ncircumstances, but he seemed much provoked at the result of his\nconversation. We expressed our surprise that he had not made Lord\nPalmerston any offer of any kind. Lord John replied he had not been\nsure what he could have offered him....\nALBERT.",

Napoleon Bonaparte, the greatest enemy that England\never had, was treated while at Plymouth with respect, and with\ncommiseration while at St Helena. Marshal Soult, who had fought\nin many battles against the English, was received with generous\nacclamation when he came here as Special Ambassador. The King of the\nFrench, Mons. Guizot, and Prince Metternich, though all of them great\nantagonists of English policy and English interests, were treated in\nthis country with courtesy and kindness. But General Haynau was looked\nupon as a great moral criminal; and the feeling in regard to him was\nof the same nature as that which was manifested towards Tawell and\nthe Mannings, with this only difference, that General Haynau's bad\ndeeds were committed upon a far larger scale, and upon a far larger\nnumber of victims. But Viscount Palmerston can assure your Majesty\nthat those feelings of just and honourable indignation have not been\nconfined to England, for he had good reason to know that General\nHaynau's ferocious and unmanly treatment of the unfortunate\ninhabitants of Brescia and of other towns and places in Italy, his\nsavage proclamations to the people of Pesth, and his barbarous acts in\nHungary excited almost as much disgust in Austria as in England, and\nthat the nickname of \"General Hy\u00e6na\" was given to him at Vienna long\nbefore it was applied to him in London.",

The danger for Germany seems to lie rather in\nthe opposite direction, arising from the rash and weak precipitation\nwith which in 1848 and 1849 those Governments which before had refused\neverything resolved in a moment of alarm to grant everything, and,\npassing from one extreme to the other, threw universal suffrage among\npeople who had been, some wholly and others very much, unaccustomed\nto the working of representative Government.

At Berlin, at Dresden, and in Baden the\nPrussian Government has very properly no doubt employed military\nforce to reestablish order; and in regard to the affairs of Hesse, the\nground taken by Prussia was not so much a constitutional as a military\none, and the objection which she made to the entrance of the troops\nof the Diet was that those troops might become hostile, and that they\nought not, therefore, to occupy a central position in the line of\nmilitary defence of Prussia.\nThe remark which your Majesty makes as to unanimity being required for\ncertain purposes by the Diet regulations is no doubt very just, and\nthat circumstance certainly shows that the free Conference which\nis about to be held is a better constructed body for planning a new\narrangement of a central organ.",

Our girls have all got one. I have\nwritten to the dear child. You should have the dear children as much\nwith you as possible; I am _sure_ it would be so _good and useful_\nfor _you_ and _them_. Children ought to have great confidence in their\nparents, in order for them to have any influence over them.\nYesterday Vicky was ten years old. It seems a dream. If she lives, in\neight years more she may be married! She is a very clever child, and I\nmust say very much improved.\nThe state of the Continent is deplorable; the folly of Austria and the\ngiving way of Prussia are lamentable. _Our_ influence on the Continent\nis _null_.... Add to this, we are between two fires in _this_ country:\na furious Protestant feeling and an enraged Catholic feeling in\nIreland. I believe that Austria fans the flame at Rome, and that\nthe _whole movement_ on the Continent is _anti-Constitutional_,\n_anti-Protestant_, _and anti-English_; and this is so complicated, and\nwe have (thanks to Lord Palmerston) contrived to quarrel _so happily_,\nseparately with each, that I do not know _how_ we are to stand against\nit all!\nI must now conclude. Trusting soon to hear from you again. Ever your\ndevoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.\nMy longing for dearest Louise seems only to increase as time goes on.",

In the former you _give me a promise_,\nwhich I consider _most_ valuable, and which I shall _remind_ you of if\nyou get desponding, viz. \"I will to please you _labour on, and do all\nthe good I can_.\" It is so pleasing to feel that one _does_ good and\ndoes one's duty. It sweetens so many bitter trials.\nThe state of Germany is indeed a very anxious one. It is a mistake\nto think the _supremacy of Prussia_ is _what is wished for_. General\nRadowitz himself says that what is necessary for Germany [is] that\nshe should take the lead, and should redeem the pledges given in '48.\nUnless this be _done_ in a moderate and determined way, a _fearful\nreaction_ will take place, which will _overturn Thrones_; to use\nRadowitz's own words: \"_und nicht vor dem Thron stehen bleiben_.\"\nPrussia is the _only large_ and powerful _really German_ Power\nthere is, and therefore she must take the lead; but her constant\nvacillation--one day doing one thing and another day another--has\ncaused her to be entirely distrusted. You are quite right in saying\nthings should be done _d'un commun accord_, and I think that the other\ngreat Powers ought to be consulted. Unfortunately, _Lord Palmerston_\nhas contrived to make us _so hated_ by all parties abroad, that we\nhave lost our position and our influence, which, considering the\nflourishing and satisfactory state of this country during all the\nEuropean convulsions, _ought_ to have been _immense_. This it is\nwhich pains and grieves me so deeply, and which I have so plainly been\nspeaking to Lord John Russell about. What a noble position we _might_\nhave had, and how wantonly has it been thrown away!\nGood Stockmar is well, and always of the _greatest_ comfort and use to\nus.

All you _say_ about _Louise_, and about the\ndisappearance _for ever_ of _all_ that _she loved_ and was _proud of_,\nis so true, so _dreadful_. One fancies (foolishly and wrongly, but\nstill one _does_) that the lost one has been hardly used in no longer\nenjoying these earthly blessings, and one's grief seems to break\nout afresh in bitter agony upon _small and comparatively trifling_\noccasions. Poor Lady Peel (whom I saw for the first time yesterday at\nBuckingham Palace, whither I had gone for an hour) expressed _this_\nstrongly. _Hers_ is indeed a _broken heart_; she is so _truly_ crushed\nby the _agony_ of _her_ grief; it was _very_ touching to see and to\nhear her. Poor thing! she _never_ can be happy again!\nWhat you say about _me_ is far too kind. I am very _often_ sadly\ndissatisfied with myself and with the little self-control I have.\nYour long letter interested us much. I fear the German affairs are\nvery bad.... That everlasting \"backwards and forwards,\" as you say,\nof my poor friend the King of Prussia is _calamitous_; it causes\n_all_ parties to distrust him, and gives _real_ strength only to the\nRepublicans. Since '48 that has been his conduct, and the _misfortune_\nfor Germany. A _steady_ course, _whatever_ it may be, is _always_ the\nbest.\nWhat you say about poor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and France is true and sad. I\nreally wish you would caution H\u00e9l\u00e8ne as to her language; she is much\nattached to you.

Hobhouse was ready to give up--receiving a Peerage, and\nretaining a seat in the Cabinet or the Admiralty, which Sir F. Baring\nwas equally ready to give up.\nWell, Sir J. Graham said that before he answered he wished to show\nLord John a correspondence which had passed between him and Lord\nLondonderry. In the course of conversation in the country, Sir James\nhad said to Lord Londonderry that parties never could go on as they\nwere, and that they must ultimately lapse into _two_; this, Lord\nLondonderry reported to Mr Disraeli, who told it to Lord Stanley;\nand Mr Disraeli wrote to Lord Londonderry, stating that if certain\nadvantages and reliefs were given to the landed interests, he\nshould not cling to Protection; in short, much what he said in his\nspeech--and that he was quite prepared to give up the lead in the\nHouse of Commons to Sir J. Graham. Sir James answered that he never\nmeant anything by what he had said, and that he had no wish whatever\nto join Lord Stanley; that if he had, he was so intimate with Lord\nStanley that he would have communicated direct with him.\nSir James said that as soon as he heard from Lord John, he thought\n_what_ he wished to see him for, and that he had been thinking over\nit, and had been talking to Lord Hardinge and Mr Cardwell. That he\ndid wish to support the Government, but that he thought he could be of\nmore use if he did not join the Government, and was able to give them\nan independent support; that he had not attempted to lead Sir Robert\nPeel's followers; that many who had followed Sir Robert would _not_\nfollow _him_; that he thought the Government in great danger; that\nthe Protectionists, Radicals, and Irish Members would try to take\nan opportunity to overset them (the Government); that should the\nGovernment be turned out, he would find no difficulty in joining them;\nor should they go on, that by-and-by it might be easier to do so; but\nthat at this moment he should be injuring himself without doing\nthe Government any real service; besides which, there were so many\nmeasures decided on which he was ignorant of, and should have to\nsupport. Lord John told him that were he in the Cabinet, he would have\nthe means of stating and enforcing his opinions, and that at whatever\ntime he joined them, there would always be the same difficulty about\nmeasures which had already been decided on. He (Sir James) is not\nquite satisfied with the Papal Aggression Bill, which he thinks will\nexasperate the Irish; he also adverted to the report of our having\nprotested against Austria bringing her Italian Provinces, etc., into\nthe German Confederation. Lord John told him that this had not been\ndone, but that we meant to ask for explanations.\nIn short, Lord John said it was evident that Sir James thought the\nGovernment in great danger, and \"did not wish to embark in a boat\nwhich was going to sink.\" Still, he was friendly, and repeated that\nit would be very easy when in opposition to unite, and then to come in\ntogether.\nVICTORIA R.",

He complained of the\nProtectionists staying away in a body on Mr King's motion, and he\n(Lord John) himself being left without a supporter even amongst\nhis colleagues in the debate, but most of all of the conduct of the\nRadicals; for when Mr King, hearing Lord John's promise to bring in\na measure next Session, wanted to withdraw his Motion, as he ought to\nhave done on such a declaration by the head of the Government, Mr Hume\ninsisted upon his going on, \"else Lord John would withdraw his promise\nagain in a fortnight\"; and when the result of the vote was made known\nthe shouting and triumph of the hundred was immense.\nLord John had declared to the Cabinet that he could not go on, that\nthe Income Tax would have to be voted the next day, and a defeat was\nprobable; it were much better therefore not to hesitate, and to resign\nat once. The Cabinet agreed, although some Members thought with Lord\nPalmerston that the occasion was hardly sufficient. Lord John begged\nto be allowed till to-day, in order to see Lord Lansdowne, whom he\nhad sent for from the country, and to be able to tender then his\nresignation; he would go down to the House to adjourn it, promising\nexplanations on Monday.\nWe agreed with Lord John that he owed to his station personally, and\nas the Queen's Minister, not to put up with ignominious treatment,\npraised his speech on the Suffrage, which is admirable, and regretted\nthat his colleagues had prevented him from bringing in a measure\nthis year. We talked of the difficulty of forming any Government, but\nagreed that Lord Stanley and the Protection Party ought to be appealed\nto; they longed for office, and would not rest quiet till they had had\nit if for ever so short a time only.\nWe further went over the ground of a possible demand for a\nDissolution, which might bring on a general commotion in the country.\nLord John agreed in this, but thought the responsibility to be very\ngreat for the Crown to refuse an appeal to the country to the new\nGovernment; he thought a decision on that point ought to depend on the\npeculiar circumstances of the case.\nLord Lansdowne, who had come from Bowood by the express train, arrived\nat twelve o'clock, and came at once to meet Lord John Russell here at\nthe Palace.\nIn the audience which the Queen gave him he expressed his entire\nconcurrence with the decision the Cabinet had come to, as the\nresignation could at any rate only have been delayed. It was clear\nthat the Cabinet had lost the confidence of the House of Commons; what\nhad happened the other night was only the last drop which made the\ncup flow over, and that it was much more dignified not to let the\nGovernment die a lingering and ignominious death; he [thought] that\nLord Stanley would have great difficulties, but would be able to form\na Government; at least the Protectionist Party gave out that they had\na Cabinet prepared.\nWe then saw Lord John Russell, who formally tendered his resignation,\nand was very much moved on taking leave; he said that, considering\nLord Stanley's principles, it would not be possible for him to hold\nout any hope of support to that Government, except on the estimates\nfor which he felt responsible, but he would at all times be ready\nvigorously to defend the Crown, which was in need of every support in\nthese days.\nAt three o'clock came Lord Stanley, whom the Queen had summoned.\nThe Queen informed him of the resignation of the Government, in\nconsequence of the late vote, which had been the result of the\nProtectionists staying away, of the small majority which the\nGovernment had had upon Mr Disraeli's Motion, and of the many symptoms\nof want of confidence exhibited towards the Government in the House\nof Commons. The Queen had accepted their resignation, and had sent\nfor him as the head of that Party, which was now the most numerous in\nOpposition, in order to ask him whether he could undertake to form a\nGovernment.\nLord Stanley expressed great surprise. The impression had been that\nthe Government had not been in earnest in their opposition to Mr L.\nKing's Motion; in the minority had voted only twenty-seven members of\nthe Government side, the rest had been of his Party. He asked if the\nwhole Cabinet had resigned, or whether there had been dissension in\nthe Cabinet upon it? The Queen replied that the resignation had been\nunanimously agreed upon in the Cabinet, and that Lord Lansdowne,\nwho had only come up from Bowood this morning, had given his entire\napproval to it. Lord Stanley then asked whether anybody else had\nbeen consulted or applied to, to which the Queen replied that she had\nwritten to him a few minutes after Lord John's resignation, and had\ncommunicated with no one else. Lord Stanley then said that he hoped\nthe Queen's acceptance had only been a conditional one; that he felt\nvery much honoured by the Queen's confidence; that he hoped he\nmight be able to tender advice which might contribute to the Queen's\ncomfort, and might relieve the present embarrassment.\nIn order to be able to do so he must enter most freely and openly into\nhis own position and that of his Party. It was quite true that they\nformed the most numerous in Parliament after the supporters of what\nhe hoped he might still call the _present_ Government, but that there\nwere no men contained in it who combined great ability with experience\nin public business. There was one certainly of great ability and\ntalent--Mr Disraeli--but who had never held office before, and perhaps\nMr Herries, who possessed great experience, but who did not command\ngreat authority in the House of Commons; that he should have great\ndifficulties in presenting to the Queen a Government fit to be\naccepted, unless he could join with some of the late Sir R. Peel's\nfollowers; that he considered, for instance, the appointment of a good\nperson for Foreign Affairs indispensable, and there was scarcely any\none fit for it except Lord Palmerston and Lord Aberdeen. Lord Aberdeen\nhad told him that he had no peculiar views upon Free Trade, and that\nhe did not pretend to understand the question, but that he had felt it\nhis duty to stand by Sir R. Peel; this might now be different, but\nit ought first to be ascertained whether a combination of those\nwho agreed in principle, and had only been kept asunder hitherto by\n_personal_ considerations, could not be formed; that Sir James Graham\nhad in his last speech declared it as his opinion that the ranks of\nthose who agreed ought to be closed; when such a combination had taken\nplace, those of Sir R. Peel's followers who could not agree to\nit might not be unwilling to join him (Lord Stanley). As to his\nprinciples, he would frankly state that he thought that the landed\ninterest was much depressed by the low state of prices; that an import\nduty on corn would be absolutely necessary, which, however, would be\nlow, and only a revenue duty; such a duty, he thought, the country\nwould be prepared for; and if they were allowed to state their honest\nopinion, he felt sure the greatest part of the present Government\nwould be heartily glad of. He would require Duties upon sugar\nfor revenue, but he could not conceal that if the revenue after a\ndiminution in the direct taxation, which he would propose, should\nconsiderably fall off, he might be driven to raise the Import duties\non other articles. He thought the present House of Commons could\nhardly be expected to reverse its decision upon the financial and\ncommercial policy of the country, and that accordingly a Dissolution\nof Parliament would become necessary. Such a Dissolution, however,\ncould not be undertaken at this moment for the sake of public\nbusiness. The Mutiny Bill had not been voted nor the Supplies, and it\nwould require more than eight weeks before the new Parliament could\nbe assembled, and consequently the Crown would be left without Army or\nmoney. A Dissolution could accordingly not take place before Easter.\nHe felt, however, that if he were to take office now, he would between\nthis and Easter be exposed to such harassing attacks that he should\nnot be able to withstand them; moreover, it would subject the members\nof his Government to two elections in two months. He hoped therefore\nthat the Queen would try to obtain a Government by a coalition of the\nWhigs and Peelites, but that this failing, if the Queen should send\nagain for him, and it was clear no other Government could be formed,\nhe would feel it his duty as a loyal subject to risk everything,\nexcept his principles and his honour, to carry on the Government; and\nhe hoped that in such a case the Queen would look leniently on the\ncomposition of the Cabinet which he could offer, and that the country\nwould, from the consideration of the circumstances, give it a fair\ntrial. He begged, however, that he might not be called upon to take\noffice except as a _dernier ressort_, a _necessity_.\nI interrupted him when he spoke of his financial measures, and begged\nhim further to explain, when it appeared that a duty of about six\nshillings on corn was the least he could impose to bring up the price\nto forty-five shillings, which Sir R. Peel had stated to the House of\nCommons was in his opinion the lowest price wheat would fall to after\nthe abolition of the Corn Laws.\nWe expressed our doubts as to the country agreeing to such a measure,\nand our apprehension of the violent spirit which would be roused in\nthe working classes by a Dissolution for that purpose, which Lord\nStanley, however, did not seem to apprehend; on the contrary, he\nthought the distress of the farmers would lead to the destruction of\nthe landed interest, which was the only support to the Throne.\nI told him that the Queen and certainly myself had been under a\ndelusion, and that I was sure the country was equally so, as to\nhis intention to return to Protection. Sometimes it was stated that\nProtection would be adhered to, sometimes that it was given up,\nand that it was _compensation_ to the landed interest which the\nProtectionists looked to. His last speeches and the Motion of Mr\nDisraeli led to that belief, but that it was of the highest importance\nthat the country should know exactly what was intended; the Queen\nwould then have an opportunity of judging how the nation looked upon\nthe proposal. I hoped therefore that the declaration of his opinions\nwhich Lord Stanley had now laid before the Queen would be clearly\nenunciated by him in Parliament when the Ministerial explanations\nshould take place, which would naturally follow this crisis.\nLord Stanley merely answered that he hoped that no explanations would\ntake place before a Government was formed. He said he should wish the\nword \"Protection\" to be merged, to which I rejoined that though he\nmight wish this, I doubted whether the country would let him.\nBefore taking leave, he repeated over and over again his advice that\nthe Coalition Ministry should be tried.\nALBERT.",

    "body": "Sir James Graham, who had been out of Town, came at six o'clock,\nhaving received my letter on his return. Lord John Russell had been\nhere before that time.\nAfter having stated to him (Lord John) what had passed with Lord\nStanley, we told him that Sir James Graham was here; Lord John seemed\nmuch surprised at Lord Stanley's refusal to form an Administration,\ndeclared himself ready to do what he could towards the formation of a\nnew Government on an extended basis, but thought that Sir James Graham\nand Lord Aberdeen should have the first offer.\nI went accordingly over to my room, where Sir James was waiting. He\nwas entirely taken by surprise by the announcement of the resignation\nof the Government, and begged to be able to state to me how he was\nsituated before he saw the Queen and Lord John.\nI then communicated to him what had passed with Lord Stanley, upon\nwhich we had a conversation of more than an hour, of which the chief\nfeatures were:\n1. Apprehension on the part of Sir James Graham lest the attempt on\nthe part of Lord Stanley to re-impose Protective duties should produce\nuniversal commotion in the country, which would be increased by the\nDissolution, without which Lord Stanley would not be able to proceed.\n2. His disbelief that Lord Aberdeen would be able to join in any\nGovernment abandoning Sir R. Peel's principles, as he had been\nconsulted before and after Sir James's late speech in which he\nexpressed his entire concurrence.\n3. His own utter weakness, calling himself the weakest man in England,\nwho had lost his only friend in Sir R. Peel, and had for the last\nfifteen years not exercised an independent judgment, but rested\nentirely on his friend.\n4. His disagreement with some of his late colleagues--the Duke of\nNewcastle, Mr Gladstone, and Mr Sidney Herbert--in religious opinions.\n5. His disagreement with Lord John's Government upon some most\nimportant points.\nHe could not take office with Lord Palmerston as Foreign Secretary,\nwhose policy and mode of conducting business he disapproved, who\nwas now protesting against the admission of Austria into the German\nConfederation; he disapproved the Papal Aggression Bill, finding it\nmilitating against the line which he had taken as Secretary of State\nwith regard to the Roman Catholic Bishops in Ireland, and particularly\nthe Bequest Act, and considering that after Lord John's letter the\nBill would fall short of the high expectations formed in the minds of\nthe English public.\nHe disapproved of the abolition of the Irish Lord-Lieutenancy, and the\nmaking a fourth Secretary of State had been considered by Sir\nRobert Peel and himself as introducing into England all the Irish\nmalpractices, while Ireland was still kept wholly separate from\nEngland.\nLord John had raised a new difficulty by his declaration upon Reform.\nHe had been thunderstruck when he read the announcement on the part\nof the chief author of the Reform Bill, who had stood with him (Sir\nJ. Graham) hitherto upon _finality_, condemning his own work, and\npromising at a year's distance important alterations, in which\ninterval great agitation would be got up, great expectations raised,\nand the measure when brought forward would cause disappointment. Sir\nRobert Peel had always been of opinion that it was most dangerous to\ntouch these questions, but if opened with the consent of the Crown, a\nmeasure should at once be brought forward and passed.\nAfter my having replied to these different objections, that the Queen\nfelt herself the importance of Lord Palmerston's removal, and would\nmake it herself a condition with Lord John that he should not be again\nForeign Secretary; that the protest to Austria had not gone, and that\nupon studying the question Sir James would find that the entrance of\nthe whole Austrian Monarchy, while giving France a pretext for war and\ninfringing the Treaties of 1815, would not tend to the strength and\nunity of Germany, which held to be the true English interest, but\nquite the reverse; that I did not think the Papal Aggression Bill\ntouched the Bequest Act or militated against toleration; that the\nLieutenancy would perhaps be given up, and a measure on the Franchise\nbe considered by the _new_ Government and brought forward at once.\nI thought it would be better to discuss the matters with Lord John\nRussell in the Queen's presence, who accordingly joined us.\nThe discussion which now arose went pretty much over the same ground,\nLord John agreeing that Lord Palmerston ought to form no difficulty,\nthat the Papal Aggression Bill would be further modified, that the\nLieutenancy Bill might be given up, that he agreed to Sir James's\nobjection to the declaration about reform, but that he had intended to\nbring forward a measure, if he had been able to get his colleagues to\nagree to it, that he would be ready to propose a measure at once. This\nSir J. Graham thought important as a means of gaining at a General\nElection, which he foresaw could not be long delayed, whoever formed a\nGovernment.\nIn order to obtain some result from this long debate I summed up what\nmight be considered as agreed upon, viz. That there was _tabula rasa_,\nand for the new Coalition a free choice of men and measures, to which\nthey assented, Lord John merely stating that he could not take office\nwithout part of his friends, and could not sacrifice his _personal_\ndeclarations. Dinnertime having approached, and Lord Aberdeen having\nwritten that he would be with us after nine o'clock, we adjourned the\nfurther discussion till then, when they would return.\nWhilst the Queen dressed I had an interview with the Duke of\nWellington, who had come to dine here, in which I informed him of\nthe nature of our crisis. He expressed his regret and his dread of a\nProtectionist Government with a Dissolution, which might lead to civil\ncommotion. He could not forgive, he said, the high Tory Party for\ntheir having stayed away the other night on Mr Locke King's Motion,\nand thus abandoned their own principles; he had no feeling for Lord\nJohn Russell's Cabinet, measures, or principles, but he felt that\nthe Crown and the country were only safe in these days by having the\nLiberals in office, else they would be driven to join the Radical\nagitation against the institutions of the country.\nAfter dinner we resumed our adjourned debate in my room, at a quarter\nto ten, with Lord Aberdeen, and were soon joined by Lord John and Sir\nJames Graham. We went over the same ground with him. Lord Stanley's\nletter was read and discussed. Lord Aberdeen declared his inability to\njoin in a Protectionist Ministry; he did not pretend to understand the\nquestion of Free Trade, but it was a point of honour with him not to\nabandon it, and now, since Sir R. Peel's death, a matter of piety.\nHe thought the danger of a Dissolution on a question of food by the\nCrown, for the purpose of imposing a tax upon bread, of the utmost\ndanger for the safety of the country. He disapproved the Papal Bill,\nthe abolition of the Lieutenancy, he had no difficulty upon the\nFranchise, for though he was called a _despot_, he felt a good deal of\nthe Radical in him sometimes.\nLord John put it to Lord Aberdeen, whether _he_ would not undertake to\nform a Government, to which Lord Aberdeen gave no distinct reply.\nAs Sir James Graham raised nothing but difficulties, though professing\nthe greatest readiness to be of use, and as it was getting on towards\nmidnight, we broke up, with the Queen's injunction that _one_ of\nthe three gentlemen _must_ form a Government, to which Lord Aberdeen\nlaughingly replied: \"I see your Majesty has come into the Pr\u00e9sident\nde la R\u00e9publique.\" Lord John was to see Lord Lansdowne _to-day_ at\nthree o'clock, and would report progress to the Queen at five o'clock.\nOn one point we were agreed, viz. that the Government to be formed\nmust not be for the moment, but with a view to strength and stability.\nALBERT.",

He thought his\nMemorandum had been misunderstood: the nature of the Reform Bill\nwas left open to discussion, and what he had said about filling the\nOffices only meant that the Offices should not be divided according to\nnumber, and each party left to fill up its share, as had been done in\nformer Coalition Ministries. He had seen Lord Palmerston, who was not\nwilling to give up the Foreign Office--spoke of retiring from business\nat his age, of his success in conducting Foreign Affairs, and of its\nbeing a self-condemnation if he accepted another Office. Lord John\ntold him that he did not agree in this view, that the Lord-Lieutenancy\nof Ireland was to be maintained, and thought it best to leave it\nthere. He thought Lord Palmerston had given up the idea of leading\nthe House of Commons. We ascertained from him in conversation that he\ncould not agree to Lord Aberdeen taking the Foreign Office nor that he\ncould serve under Lord Aberdeen or Sir James Graham in case any one of\nthese were to form a Government.\nAt half-past six Lord John returned from the House of Commons, and\nreported that two very important events had taken place: the one that\nupon his making his statement to the House that the Government had\nresigned, that Lord Stanley had been sent for, had declared _his\ninability then to form a Government_ (words agreed upon between\nLord Lansdowne, Lord John, and Sir George Grey), and that he was now\ncharged with the formation of a Government, Mr. Disraeli got up, and\ndenied that Lord Stanley had declined forming a Government, which was\nreceived with cheers from the Protectionists. Lord John had merely\nanswered that when Lord Stanley would make his explanations, what he\nhad stated would be found to be correct, relying entirely, not upon\nwhat the Queen had communicated, but on Lord Stanley's own letter. The\nsecond event was a letter from Lord Aberdeen and Sir James Graham,\nwhich put _an end_ to all _thoughts_ of a Coalition. It stated that\nthey could agree to no legislation whatever on the Papal Aggressions,\nand ended with a hint that Sir James Graham was prepared to go farther\nin reductions than Lord John was likely to consent to.\nLord John had at once answered that although he did not understand the\nlatter objection, the difference on the Papal Bill must put an end\nto their negotiation. We much lamented the result, and after some\ndiscussion agreed that the only thing to be done now was to send for\nLord Aberdeen.

    "body": "Lord Aberdeen and Sir James Graham came yesterday evening at nine\no'clock; the Queen put it to them whether _they_ could form a\nGovernment, to which they replied that they had turned it in their\nheads a hundred times, that there was nothing they would not do to\nshow their readiness to serve the Queen, but that they did not see a\npossibility of forming an Administration which could stand a day. They\nwere most likely at that moment the two most unpopular men in England,\nhaving declared that nothing should be done in Parliament against the\nPapal Aggression, which the whole country clamoured for; the Whigs\nwould be very angry with them for their having broken up the new\ncombination; they might find favour with the Radicals, but that was\na support upon which no reliance could be placed. There was a growing\nopinion that Lord Stanley ought to have a chance of bringing forward\nhis measures; that it was perilous, but that it was an evil which must\nbe gone through; that this opinion had been strongly expressed by Lord\nLansdowne, whose moderation nobody could doubt; that it was shared by\nthe Duke of Newcastle, Mr Sidney Herbert, and others of Sir James's\nfriends whom he had had time to consult.\nUpon the Queen's expression of her great apprehension as to the\nconsequence of such a step on the country, they said there would\nno doubt spring up a most violent opposition, that there would be\nattempts to stop the supplies and dissolve the Army, but that Lord\nJohn Russell and Sir James Graham together would do their utmost to\npreach moderation, and would refer the House of Commons to the Queen's\nexample, who had taken strictly the Constitutional course throughout\nthe crisis, whose opinions on Free Trade were well known (as far as\nsubjects could allow themselves to pretend to know their Sovereign's\n_private_ opinions) from the hearty support she had given to Sir\nRobert Peel's and Lord John's Governments. That upon the first\nproposition of a Stanley Government the junction of Parties would\nbe completed, and there would be only _one_ strong opposition. After\nhaving fought together, there would be no longer any difficulty about\nforming a strong Government out of their joint ranks, whilst now it\nwas impossible not to see that every Minister displaced would feel\npersonally aggrieved, that then they stood on a footing of perfect\nequality. Sir James had seen Lord John since he had tendered his\nsecond resignation, and found him quite altered; whilst he was\nembarrassed and _boutonn\u00e9_ before, he was open and unreserved now, and\nthey could speak on terms of private friendship. Lord Aberdeen would\nsave his influence in the House of Lords, which he would probably have\nlost if he had joined the Whigs in office; in future all this would be\ndifferent.\nLord John Russell's letter with the Memoranda came and interrupted us.\nFrom these papers, and what Sir James and Lord Aberdeen said, it is\nclear that all parties are relieved by the failure of their attempt\nto form a Coalition Government, but determined to form a positive\njunction, which will be most salutary to the country. The Queen will\ntherefore send for Lord Stanley.\nWe discussed further the means Lord Stanley would have to form an\nAdministration, for which the material was certainly sad.

    "body": "Lord Stanley obeyed the Queen's summons at eleven o'clock, and seemed\nvery much concerned when she informed him that Lord John Russell had\ngiven up his task, as differences of opinion, particularly on the\nPapal Bill, had prevented a junction between him, Lord Aberdeen, and\nSir James Graham; that an appeal to Lord Aberdeen had been equally\nunsuccessful from the same cause, viz. their difficulty in dealing\nwith the Papal Question; that consequently the contingency had arisen\nunder which Lord Stanley had promised to undertake the formation of a\nGovernment.\nLord Stanley said his difficulties were immense, and he could not\nventure to approach them unless he was sure of every support on the\npart of the Crown; that he would have arrayed against him a formidable\nopposition of all the talent in the country.\nThe Queen assured him that he should have every Constitutional support\non her part, of which Lord Stanley repeated he had felt sure, although\nthe total change must be very trying to the Queen.\nOn his question, whether there was any hope of Lord Aberdeen joining\nhim and taking the Foreign Office, we had to tell him that he must\nquite discard that idea. He replied, with a sigh, that he would still\ntry and see him; he had thought of the Duke of Wellington taking the\nForeign Office _ad interim_, but felt that he could hardly propose\nthat, considering the Duke's age and infirmity; he would make an\nattempt to see Lord Canning with the Queen's permission, and\nthat failing, could only think of Sir Stratford Canning, now at\nConstantinople, which the Queen approved.\nHe still hoped he might get Mr Gladstone to take the lead in the House\nof Commons, without which assistance he must not conceal that it was\nalmost impossible for him to go on. Mr Gladstone was on his way\nhome from Paris, and he had written to him to see him as soon as he\narrived; till then he could not promise that he would succeed to\nform an Administration, and he only undertook it for the good of his\ncountry, but was afraid of ruining his reputation.\nTo this I rejoined that who tried to do the best by his country need\nnever be afraid for his reputation.\nThe Queen showed Lord Stanley Lord John Russell's letter respecting Mr\nDisraeli's denial of the truth of Lord John's statement in the House\nof Commons yesterday.\nLord Stanley said it had been a very unfortunate misunderstanding,\nthat he had been sorry Lord John and Lord Lansdowne should have felt\nit necessary to say that \"he had not _then_ been prepared to form a\nGovernment,\" as the knowledge of this fact, as long as there was a\nchance of his being called back, could not but act injuriously to him\nand dispirit those with whom he acted. He would explain all this on\nFriday in the House of Lords, and had no objection to sending Lord\nJohn a copy of his letter.\nWe now came to _Measures_. Lord Stanley hopes to obviate the Papal\nQuestion by a Parliamentary declaration and the appointment in both\nHouses of a Committee to enquire into the position of the Roman\nCatholic Church in this country; he would diminish the Income Tax by a\nmillion, and exempt temporary incomes; he would allow compounding for\nthe Window Tax and levy a moderate duty on corn, which he called a\nCountervailing Duty, and tried to defend as good political economy, on\nthe authority of Mr M'Culloch's last edition of \"Ricardo.\" (I had some\ndiscussion with him, however, on that point.)\nReturning to the offices to be filled, Lord Stanley said he should\nhave to propose Mr Disraeli as one of the Secretaries of State. The\nQueen interrupted him by saying that she had not a very good opinion\nof Mr Disraeli on account of his conduct to poor Sir R. Peel, and what\nhad just happened did not tend to diminish that feeling; but that she\nfelt so much Lord Stanley's difficulties, that she would not aggravate\nthem by passing a sentence of exclusion on him. She must, however,\nmake Lord Stanley responsible for his conduct, and should she have\ncause to be displeased with him when in office, she would remind Lord\nStanley of what now passed. Lord Stanley promised to be responsible,\nand excused his friend for his former bitterness by his desire to\nestablish his reputation for cleverness and sharpness; nobody had\ngained so much by Parliamentary schooling, and he had of late quite\nchanged his tone.\nMr Herries would make a good Chancellor of the Exchequer.\nAs to Ireland, he had thought of having a more ostensible\nLord-Lieutenant, whilst the business should be done by the Secretary\nfor Ireland. He asked the Queen whether the Duke of Cambridge might\nbe offered that post, which she took _ad referendum_. The Duke of\nNorthumberland, though not of his Party, he should like to offer the\nAdmiralty to.\nAt the conclusion of the interview he broached the important question\nof Dissolution, and said that a Dissolution would anyhow become\nnecessary; that, if it was thought that the Queen would withhold\nfrom him the privilege of dissolving, he would not have the slightest\nchance in the House of Commons; he would be opposed and beat, and then\nhis adversaries would come in and dissolve. He avowed that it could\nnot be said that the Queen had refused him the power of dissolving,\nbut he required some assurance.\nOn the Queen's objecting to giving him a contingent positive promise,\nbut declaring her readiness fairly to discuss the question when the\nemergency arose, he contented himself with the permission to deny,\nif necessary, that she would _not_ consent to it, putting entire\nconfidence in the Queen's intention to deal fairly by him.\nI tried to convince Lord Stanley, and I hope not without effect, of\nthe advantage, both to the Queen and Lord Stanley himself, that they\nshould not be hampered by a positive engagement on that point, which\nmight become very inconvenient if circumstances arose which made a\nDissolution dangerous to the country.\nALBERT.",

    "body": "Lord Stanley arrived at half-past five o'clock. We were struck by the\nchange of his countenance, which had lost all the expression of care\nand anxiety which had marked it at the previous interviews.\nHe assured the Queen that he had been labouring incessantly since he\nhad seen her last, but that he was sorry to say without any success.\nHe had seen Mr Gladstone, who declined joining his Government\non account of his previous pledges in Parliament respecting the\nCommercial Policy of Sir R. Peel, but evidently also on account of his\npeculiar views with respect to the Papal Aggression, which he did not\nseem disposed to look upon as in any way objectionable.\nLord Canning had given him some hope at one time, but finally declined\nin order not to risk his credit for political consistency.\nMr H. Corry, whose opinions on Free Trade were by no means decided,\nand who had only filled a very subordinate situation in Sir R. Peel's\nGovernment, he had offered high office, but was refused, Mr Corry\nexpressing his fears that the Government had no chance of standing\nagainst the opposition it would have to meet in the House of Commons.\nThe Duke of Northumberland was the only person not properly belonging\nto the Protection Party who had accepted office (First Lord of the\nAdmiralty). At one time Lord Ellenborough had accepted, but having\nbeen sent on a mission to Mr Goulburn in order to see whether he\ncould convert him, he came home himself converted, and withdrew his\nacceptance again.\nIn this situation Lord Stanley called his friends together, and after\nsome discussion concurred in their opinion that it was not possible\nfor them to form such an Administration as ought to be offered to the\nQueen. Lord Stanley then qualified this expression again, and said\nthat though he could have offered a very respectable Government if\nhe had had a majority in the House of Commons, or the means of\nstrengthening himself by an immediate Dissolution, he could not form\nsuch a one which could have withstood an adverse majority and such a\nformidable array of talent in the Opposition. He therefore returned\nthe trust which had been committed to him into the Queen's hands,\nexpressing at the same time his deep sense of gratitude for the\nkindness with which she had treated him, the support and confidence\nshe had given him, sorry only that it should have led to no result.\nHe thought, however, that the prolongation of the crisis had not\ninconvenienced the public service, as Her Majesty's _present_\nGovernment were constitutionally enabled to carry on all necessary\nbusiness.\nThe Queen rejoined that she was very sorry that this attempt had also\nfailed, that she had tried every possible combination, and still was\nwithout a Government. Lord Stanley answered as if he considered\nit natural that Lord John Russell's Government should now quietly\nproceed; but on the Queen's observation, that it was now necessary\nthat all Parties should join in the support of some measures at least,\nand particularly the Papal Bill, he stated what he was prepared to\nsupport, and would have been prepared to propose had he taken office,\nviz. a fuller recital in the preamble of the Bill and no penal clause\nin the body of it. (The present Bill looked pettish and undignified,\nas if framed in anger as a return for the insult, and not a correction\nof the state of the law.) He thought the Law very complex and obscure,\nand never found it acted upon. He would have proposed therefore that\nCommittees of both Houses should enquire into the whole subject; the\nstate of the Convents; whether subjects were detained against their\nwill; whether people were forced to bequeath their property to the\nChurch on the deathbed, etc., etc.; he knew that the Roman Catholic\nlaity felt severely the oppression which the Priests exercised over\nthem, and would be willing to give evidence.\nLord Stanley asked whether it could be of use if he were to state all\nthis in his explanation to-day, which the Queen strongly affirmed. I\nadded that I hoped he would explain what he was prepared to do on all\nthe subjects in dispute--the Commercial and Financial Policy as well.\nHe promised to do so, and entered into his views on the Income Tax,\nwhich he called a War Tax, which had been imposed for temporary\npurposes only in 1842, and ought to be taken off again when\npracticable in order to keep faith with the public; but if, as often\nas there was a surplus, this was immediately absorbed by remission of\nother burdens, this object could never be fulfilled. He would\npropose that by degrees, as surpluses arose, the Income Tax should be\ndecreased, and so on to its final repeal.\nI disputed with him for some time on the advantages of an Income Tax,\nbut without coming to any result.\nOn his enquiry whether there was anything else the Queen might wish\nhim to state--perhaps the rumour that he had been refused the power of\ndissolving--we agreed that he should say the question had never been\nseriously entertained, but that the Queen had been ready to give him\nthe same support and advantages which any other Government might have\nenjoyed.\nALBERT.",

He was\nvery apprehensive lest to begin a new Government with an open question\nwould produce the greatest prejudice against it in the public; he was\nstill inclined therefore to recommend the continuance of the present\nGovernment avowedly for the purpose of passing the Papal Bill, after\nwhich the Coalition might take place, which, however, should be agreed\nupon and settled at this time. As the Duke of Wellington has not yet\nsent his promised Memorandum, and Lord Lansdowne was anxious to hear\nhis opinion, the Queen commissioned him to appoint Lord John Russell\nto come at three o'clock, and to go himself to the Duke of Wellington.\nLord John Russell, who arrived at the appointed time, and had not seen\nLord Lansdowne's Memorandum yet, read it over, and expressed great\nmisgivings about the execution of the proposal. He said he saw in\nfact, like Sir J. Graham, nothing but difficulties. He had ascertained\nthat his Party by no means liked the idea of a fusion, and had been\nmuch relieved when the attempt to form a Coalition Ministry had\nfailed. He was afraid that in the interval between their resuming\noffice and giving it up again every possible surmise would be current\nwho were the Ministers to be displaced, and every possible intrigue\nwould spring up for and against particular members of the Cabinet. He\nwould prefer not to make any arrangements for the Coalition now, but\nmerely to engage to resign again after having carried the Papal\nBill, when the Queen could try the Coalition, and that failing, could\nentrust Lord Aberdeen and Sir J. Graham with the carrying on of the\nGovernment, whose chief difficulty would then be removed. I objected\nto this--that his Party might feel justly aggrieved if after their\nhaving carried him through the difficulty of the Papal Measure, he\nwere to throw them over and resign, and asked him whether his Cabinet\nwould not repent in the meantime and wish to stay in.\nHe answered that it would be entirely in his and Lord Lansdowne's\nhands to carry out the proposed arrangements.\nWe asked him whether it would strengthen his hands if, instead of his\nonly _accepting_ the task of continuing the Government till the Papal\nMeasure had been passed, the Queen were to make it a _condition_\nin _giving_ him the Commission, that it should terminate then. He\nreplied, \"Certainly.\" He begged, however, to be understood not to have\ngiven a decided opinion that the plan of \"the open Question\" proposed\nin our Memorandum was not preferable, although he saw great objections\nto that also, particularly as Sir J. Graham had reserved the statement\nof his principal objections to the Papal Bill for the second reading.\nHe promised to draw up a Memorandum, which he would bring to-morrow\nat twelve o'clock, after having consulted some of his colleagues,\nand begged that it might not be considered that he had accepted the\nGovernment till then.\nOne of the difficulties which we likewise discussed was the position\nof the financial measures which required almost immediate attention,\nand still ought to be left open for the consideration of the future\nGovernment.\nWe agreed that the pressing on the Papal Measure was the chief point,\nand that it ought to be altered to meet the objections (as far as they\nare reasonable) of its opponents, strengthening the declaratory part,\nhowever, to please Lord Stanley; and the Queen promised to call upon\nLord Stanley to give this so modified Bill the support of himself and\nhis Party, which we thought she could in fairness claim after all that\nhad happened.\nThe Queen reiterated her objections to Lord Palmerston, and received\nthe renewed promise that her wishes should be attended to.\nALBERT.",

On\nproposing to his former colleagues the plan of keeping Office now,\nand vacating it after the Aggression Bill had passed, many of them,\namongst which were Lord Grey, Sir Charles Wood, Sir Francis Baring,\ndeclared they would not be _warming-pans_ (an expression used at the\ntime of the Grey-Grenville Coalition), and would resign at once. The\nDuke of Wellington, whose opinion the Queen had asked, had recommended\nthe return of the old Cabinet to power. He (Lord John) could therefore\nonly advise that course, although he was conscious that it would be a\nvery weak Government, and one not likely to last any length of time.\nHe then read the Memorandum which he had drawn up and which follows\nhere.\nThe Queen now asked whether Lord John proposed a modification of\nhis own Cabinet, to which Lord John replied, None, except perhaps\nan exchange of Office between Sir C. Wood and Sir F. Baring, if Sir\nCharles were to refuse bringing in a different budget from the one he\nhad already propounded; he was for maintaining the Income Tax, whilst\nSir Francis was for repealing it by degrees. The Queen then reminded\nLord John of her objections to Lord Palmerston, and his promise\nthat Lord Palmerston should not again be thrust upon her as Foreign\nSecretary.

He said he was very anxious that he and Lord Lansdowne\nshould bear the responsibility of removing Lord Palmerston from the\nForeign Office and not the Queen; her refusal now could only go to the\ncountry as a personal objection on her part, and the country would be\nleft without a Government in consequence. On the Queen's reiterating\nthat she wanted to keep Lord John and get rid of Lord Palmerston, and\nthat it was too painful to her to be put into the situation of having\nactually to _wish_ the fall of her own Government, Lord John promised\nto move Lord Palmerston in the Easter recess, or to resign then\nhimself if he should meet with difficulties; in the meantime he must\napprise Lord Palmerston of this intention, which he could explain to\nhim as a wish to make a general modification of his Government. He\nwould offer him the Lieutenancy of Ireland or the Presidency or lead\nin the House of Lords, which Lord Lansdowne would be ready to resign.\nHe might at that period perhaps get some of the Radicals into office\nor some Peelites.

    "body": "Her Majesty having tried in vain the formation of a Government--first,\nby Lord Stanley; second, by Lord John Russell, Lord Aberdeen, and\nSir James Graham; third, by Lord Aberdeen; fourth, by Lord Stanley\na second time--had recourse to the advice and opinion of the Duke of\nWellington. The Duke, admitting the great qualifications for office\nof the adherents of the late Sir Robert Peel, yet advises the Queen to\nrestore her former Ministers to office.\nBut supposing Her Majesty to follow that advice, a further question\nnaturally arises: the late Government having fallen from want of\nParliamentary support, can they upon their return be in any way\nstrengthened, and be enabled to carry on the public business with more\npower and efficiency?\nThis might be done in three ways: first, by a Coalition sooner or\nlater with the Peel Party; secondly, by admitting to office some of\ntheir own Radical supporters; thirdly, by seeking aid from the Party\nwhich has followed Lord Stanley.\nThe first of these courses appears the most natural. The present\nMinisters are agreed with the adherents of Sir Robert Peel on Free\nTrade, and on the policy which has regulated our finances of late\nyears. The difference between them is of a temporary nature. But it\nmay be doubted whether any strength would be gained by an immediate\njunction with that Party.\nIf such junction took place now, the Ministers coming in must oppose\ntheir colleagues on the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill--an unseemly\nspectacle, a source of weakness, and probably the beginning of strife,\nwhich would not end with the Bill in question.\nIf, on the other hand, the junction were delayed till the\nEcclesiastical Titles Bill is disposed of, the existing Ministry would\nbe divided into two portions, one of which would have only a temporary\ntenure of office. Rumours, cabals, and intrigues would have ample room\nto spread their mischief in such a state of things.\nBut finally the Whig Party in the House of Commons would not be\ncordial supporters of the junction; jealousy and discontent would soon\nbreak up the Ministry.\nSecondly, by admitting to office some of their Radical supporters.\nThis course must lead to concessions on measures as well as men, and\nthose concessions would provoke hostility in other quarters. The great\nquestion of the defence of the country is besides one of too great\nimportance to be made a matter of compromise.\nThird, by seeking aid from the Party which has followed Lord Stanley.\nThis cannot be done by means of official connection; but something\nmight be effected by adopting measures calculated to convince the\nLanded Interest that their sufferings were not disregarded.\nUpon the whole, if the late Ministers are invited by your Majesty to\nresume office, the easiest course would be to proceed at once with\nthe Ecclesiastical Titles Bill. That question disposed of, it would\nbe seen whether the Ministry had sufficient strength to go on; if\nthey had, they might, as occasion arose, seek assistance from other\nquarters, looking to those with whom there is the greatest agreement\nof opinion.\nShould the Ministry, on the other hand, not receive Parliamentary\nsupport sufficient to enable them to carry on the Government, the\nQueen would be in a position to form a new Government free from the\nobstacles which have lately been fatal.",

The _d\u00e9nouement_ of ten days of the greatest anxiety and\nexcitement I cannot call satisfactory, for it holds out only the\nprospect of another crisis in a very short time, and the so much\nwished-for union of Parties has been again frustrated. I have been\nspeaking _very strongly_ about Lord Palmerston to Lord John, and he\nhas _promised_ that if the Government should still be in at Easter,\nthen to make a change.... Lord Stanley can never succeed _until_ he\ngives up Protection, which he would do, if the country decides against\nhim; he has failed solely from the _impossibility_ of finding\n_one_ single man capable to take the important Offices. He said last\nnight to Lord John Russell, \"I am _l'homme impossible_; they cannot\ncome to me again.\" Still it would be very desirable that there\nshould be a strong Conservative Party; nothing but the abandonment of\nProtection can bring this to pass, and Lord Stanley cannot abandon\nit with honour till _after_ the _next Election_. This is the state\nof Parties, which is greatly _erschwert_ by the Papal Question, which\ndivides the Liberals and Conservatives. In short, there _never_ was\n_such_ a _complicated_ and difficult state of affairs. Ever your\ndevoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.\nStockmar has been an immense comfort to us in our trials, and I hope\nyou will tell him so.",

I cannot tell you _how_ it has upset\nme; I have known him so long, and he was such an intimate friend of\nours. We received the news yesterday.\nMany thanks for your kind letter of the 29th. I am glad all went off\nso well, but it must have been dreadful to miss dearest Louise.\nThis time reminds me so much of all our sorrow last year on her dear\naccount.\nVICTORIA R.",

The Queen, considering\na change of her Government under present political circumstances\ndangerous to the true interests of the nation, had only to choose\nbetween two evils, without possessing sufficient confidence in her own\njudgment to decide which in its political consequences would turn out\nthe least.

In the advice which Lord John Russell has humbly\ntendered to your Majesty, he has always had in view the importance\nof maintaining the popular confidence which your Majesty's name\neverywhere inspires. Somewhat of the good opinion of the Emperor of\nRussia and other foreign Sovereigns may be lost, but the good will and\naffection of the people of England are retained, a great security in\nthese times.\nLord John Russell has made out a note of his address to the Cabinet\nfor your Majesty's information.

In the\nQueen's opinion, the chief question to consider will be whether the\nstrengthening of the Democratic principle will upset the balance of\nConstitution, and further weaken the Executive, which is by no means\ntoo strong at present.

What do you say to it?\nAs yet one cannot form an opinion, but I am inclined to think that\nLouis Bonaparte will succeed. The country is tired and wish quiet, and\nif they get it by this _coup d'\u00e9tat_ they will have no objection, and\nlet _le Gouvernement Parlementaire et Constitutionnel_ go to sleep for\na while.\nI suspect that the great Continental powers will see a military\nGovernment at Paris with pleasure; they go rather far in their hatred\nof everything Parliamentary. The President takes a little of Napoleon\nalready. I understand that he expressed himself displeased, as if I\nhad too much supported the Orleans Family. I render perfect justice to\nthe President, that hitherto he has not plagued us; but we have\nalso abstained from all interference. I think that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has been\nimprudent; besides, it is difficult for the poor Family to avoid to\nspeak on these subjects or to express themselves with mildness.\nIf something like an Empire establishes itself, perhaps we shall for\na time have much to suffer, as the _gloire fran\u00e7aise_ invariably looks\nto the old frontiers.

    "body": "MY DEAR CHARLES,--I have an opportunity of writing to you _not_\nthrough the Foreign Office, which I shall take advantage of, as at\npresent the Post is not to be trusted, and I am afraid I do not think\nthe Office is either.\nPalmerston has taken lately to writing in the most extraordinary\nmanner to Normanby. I think he wants to fix a quarrel with him,\nwhich you may be sure Normanby will avoid at present, as it would have\nthe worst possible effect; but I do not understand it at all, and I\nwish you could in any way explain what it means. Palmerston seems very\nangry because Normanby does not unqualifyingly approve of this step\nhere, and the results; the whole thing is so completely a _coup\nd'\u00e9tat_, and all the proceedings are so contrary to and devoid of law\nand justice and security, that even the most violent Tory would be\nstaggered by them. (For instance, to-day _all_ the English papers,\neven Normanby's, are stopped and prohibited; they will of course\nallow Normanby's to come, but it is to be under an envelope), and yet\nPalmerston, who quarrels with all Europe about a political adventurer\nlike Kossuth, because he was defending the liberties and constitution\nof his country, now tries to quarrel with Normanby, and really writes\nin the most impertinent manner, because Normanby's despatches are not\nsufficiently in praise of Louis Napoleon and his _coup d'\u00e9tat_. There\nmust be some _dessous des cartes_ that we are not aware of. Normanby\nhas always said, having been undertaken, the only thing now is to hope\nand pray it may be successful; but that is another thing to approving\nthe way it was begun, or the way it has been carried out. The\nbloodshed has been dreadful and indiscriminate, no quarter was shown,\nand when an insurgent took refuge in a house, the soldiers killed\nevery one in the house, whether engaged in the _\u00e9meute_ or not....\nIt is very doubtful whether Normanby will be able to go on with\n[Palmerston] if this sort of thing continues, for he talks of \"I hear\nthis\" and \"I am told that,\" with reference to Normanby's conduct here,\nwhich no man in his position can stand, as, if Palmerston takes the\n_on-dits_ of others, and not Normanby's own accounts, there is an end\nof confidence; but I must say his last letter appears to me a sort of\nexuberance of anger, which spends itself on many subjects rather than\nthe one which first caused it, and therefore I suspect he has received\nsome rap on the knuckles at home, which he resents here, or on the\nfirst person who is not of the same opinion as himself; but it is a\ncurious anomaly that he should quarrel with Normanby in support of\narbitrary and absolute Government. All is quiet here now, and will, I\nhope, continue so till the Elections, when I suppose we may have some\nmore _\u00e9meutes_....\nThey have been told at the Clubs that they may meet, but they are\nnot to talk politics. In short, I do not suppose that despotism ever\nreached such a pitch.... You may suppose what the French feel; it\nserves them all quite right, but that does not prevent one's feeling\nindignant at it. And this is what Palmerston is now supporting without\nrestriction. We are entirely without any other news from England\nfrom any one. Would you not send me or Normanby a letter through\nRothschild? I am rather anxious to know whether this is a general\nfeeling in England; it could not be, if they know all that had\nhappened here. Mind, I can quite understand the policy of keeping well\nwith Louis Napoleon, and Normanby is so, and has never expressed to\nany one a hostile opinion except in his despatches and private letters\nto Palmerston.... I shall send this by a private hand, not to run the\nrisk of its being read. Ever yours affectionately,\nM. NORMANBY.",

    "body": "MY DEAREST CHARLES,--I had written a long letter to the Queen, and\nupon second thoughts I have burnt it, because events have now become\nso serious between Normanby and Palmerston that I do not think that I\nshould be the person to inform Her Majesty of it, in case anything was\nto be said upon the subject in Parliament. And yet as the affront has\nbeen given in Palmerston's private letters, I feel sure she does not\nknow it. You have all probably seen Normanby's public despatches, in\nwhich, though as an Englishman he deprecates and deplores the means\nemployed and the pledges broken--in short, the unconstitutional\nillegality of the whole _coup d'\u00e9tat_--yet he always says, seeing now\nno other refuge from Rouge ascendency, he hopes it may succeed. One\nwould have supposed, from the whole tenor of his policy, from his\nRadical tendencies, and all that he has been doing lately, that\nPalmerston would have been the last person to approve of this _coup\nd'\u00e9tat_. Not a bit! He turns upon Normanby in the most flippant\nmanner; almost accuses him of a concealed knowledge of an Orleanist\nplot--never whispered here, nor I believe, even imagined by the\nGovernment of Paris, who would have been too glad to seize upon it\nas an excuse; says he compromises the relations of the country by his\nevident disapproval of Louis Napoleon--in short, it is a letter that\nMorny might have written, and that it is quite impossible for Normanby\nto bear. The curious thing is that it is a letter or rather letters\nthat would completely ruin Palmerston with _his_ Party. He treats all\nthe acts of the wholesale cruelties of the troops as a joke--in short,\nit is the letter of a man half mad, I think, for to quarrel with\nNormanby on this subject is cutting his own throat.... He has written\nalso to Lord John. Louis Napoleon knows perfectly well that Normanby\ncannot approve the means he has taken; he talks to him confidentially,\nand treats him as an honest, upright man, and he never showed him\nmore attention, or friendship even than last night when we were at the\nElys\u00e9e, though Normanby said not one word in approval....\nThere is another question upon which Normanby has a right to complain,\nwhich is, that two days before Palmerston sent his instructions here,\nhe expressed to Walewski his complete approval of the step taken by\nLouis Napoleon, which was transmitted by Walewski in a despatch to\nTurgot, and read by him to many members of the Corps Diplomatique a\nday before Normanby heard a word from Palmerston. You will perhaps\nthink that there is not enough in all this to authorise the grave step\nNormanby has taken, but the whole tone of his letters shows such a\nwant of confidence, is so impertinent--talk of \"we hear this,\" and \"we\nare told that,\"--bringing a sort of anonymous gossip against a man of\nNormanby's character and standing, that respect for himself obliges\nNormanby to take it up seriously.... In the meantime our Press in\nEngland is, as usual, _too_ violent against Louis Napoleon. _We_\nhave no friends or true allies left, thanks to the policy of Lord\nPalmerston; as soon as the peace of the country is restored the Army\n_must_ be employed; it is the course of a Military Government; as\nmuch as an absolute Government is destroyed by the people, and the\ndemocracy again, when fallen into anarchy, is followed by Military\nGovernment. Louis Napoleon must maintain his position by acts: they\nwill find out that Belgium should belong to France, or Alsace, or\nAntwerp, or something or other that England will not be able to allow,\nand then how are we prepared for the consequences?...\nThe more I think of Palmerston's letters, the less I can understand\nthem; every sentence is in direct contradiction to his acts and words.\nHe ridicules the idea of the Constitution; turns to scorn the idea of\nanything being due to the Members of the Assembly; laughs and jokes at\nthe Club being fired into, though the English people in it were\nwithin an ace of being murdered by the soldiers; says that Normanby\nis pathetic over a broken looking-glass, forgetting that the same\nbullet grazed the hand of an Englishman, \"_a Roman citizen!_\" who was\nbetween the window and the glass--in short, as I said before, he is\nquite incomprehensible, except, as I cannot help thinking, he read the\nprivate letter Normanby wrote to the Duke of Bedford upon the Kossuth\nbusiness, wishing to take his advice a little upon a grave question,\nbut which did not actually interfere with his position here. This\nwould account for his extreme irritation....\nAll at present is quiet in Paris. There are Socialist risings in many\nparts of the country, but all these will do the President good, and\nstrengthen his hands, for even the people who have been treated\nwith indignity will pardon him if their ch\u00e2teaux are saved from an\ninfuriated and brutal peasantry. The President told Normanby last\nnight that the accounts of the cruelties and attacks in parts of\nthe country were very serious, but he hoped they would soon be put\ndown....\nM. NORMANBY.",

Lord Lansdowne, to whom he had first written on the\nsubject, had frightened him by answering that it was not possible\nto avoid the rupture with Lord Palmerston, but that he thought the\nGovernment would after this not be able to go on. When, however, this\nquestion was discussed in Cabinet, and Lord John had stated that\nhe thought the Office could be well filled, they all agreed in the\npropriety of going on. The Members of the Cabinet were so unable to\nunderstand Lord Palmerston's motives for his conduct during these last\nmonths, that Mr. Fox Maule started an idea which once occurred to Lord\nJohn himself (as he said), viz. that he must have had the design\nto bring on a rupture! Lord Minto, who was absent from the Cabinet,\nexpressed himself in a letter to Lord John very strongly about Lord\nPalmerston's _reckless conduct_, which would yet undo the country.\nLord John, after having received the concurrence of the Cabinet on the\nquestion of Lord Palmerston's dismissal, stated that Lord Granville\nwas the person whom he would like best to see fill his office, and\nhe knew this to be the feeling of the Queen also. The Cabinet quite\nagreed in Lord Granville's fitness, but Sir George Grey stated it as\nhis opinion that it ought first to be offered to Lord Clarendon, who\nhas always been pointed out by the public as the proper person to\nsucceed Lord Palmerston, and that, if he were passed over, the whole\nmatter would have the appearance of a Cabinet intrigue in favour of\none colleague against another. The whole of the Cabinet sided with\nthis opinion, and Lord John Russell now proposed to the Queen that an\noffer should in the first instance be made to Lord Clarendon.\nThe Queen protested against the Cabinet's taking upon itself the\nappointment of its own Members, which rested entirely with the\nPrime Minister and the Sovereign, under whose approval the former\nconstructed his Government.... Lord John replied that he thought Lord\nClarendon would not accept the offer, and therefore there would be\nlittle danger in satisfying the desires of the Cabinet. He had written\nto Lord Clarendon a cautioning letter from Woburn, apprising him of\nsome serious crisis, of which he would soon hear, and speaking of his\nformer wish to exchange the Lord-Lieutenancy for some other Office.\nLord Clarendon at once perceived the drift of the hint, and wrote\nto the Duke of Bedford what he said he did not wish to write to his\nbrother John, that, if it was that Palmerston was going, and _he_ were\nthought of as a successor, nothing would be so disagreeable to him,\nas the whole change would be put down as an intrigue of his, whom Lord\nPalmerston had always accused of wishing to supplant him; that if,\nhowever, the service of the country required it, he had the courage to\nface all personal obloquy....\nLord John owned that Sir George Grey's chief desire was to see Lord\nClarendon removed from Ireland, having been there so long; the\nCabinet would wish to see the Duke of Newcastle join the Government\nas Lord-Lieutenant, which he might be induced to do. The Queen having\nmentioned Lord Clarendon as most fit to succeed Lord Lansdowne one\nday as President of the Council and leader in the House of Lords, Lord\nJohn said that Lord Clarendon had particularly begged not to have the\nposition offered him, for which he did not feel fit. Lord John would\nlike him as Ambassador at Paris, and thought Lord Clarendon would\nlike this himself; but it was difficult to know what to do with Lord\nNormanby.\nIn the course of the conversation, Lord John congratulated the\nQueen upon the change having been accomplished without her personal\nintervention, which might have exposed her to the animosity of Lord\nPalmerston's admirers, whilst she would have been precluded from\nmaking any public defence. I reminded Lord John that, as such was the\ndisadvantage of the regal position, it behoved the Queen doubly to\nwatch, lest she be put into the same dilemma with a new Minister,\nwhose conduct she could not approve of. Lord Clarendon's appointment\nwould be doubly galling to Lord Palmerston, whom Lord John might not\nwish to irritate further, a consideration which Lord John said he had\nalso pressed upon the Cabinet. Upon a remark from Lord John as to Lord\nGranville's youth, the Queen replied: \"Lord Canning, whom Lord Stanley\nhad intended to make his Foreign Secretary, was not older....\"\nThe conference ended by Lord John's promise to write to Lord Clarendon\nas the Queen had desired ... but that he did not wish to make the\noffer to Lord Granville till he had Lord Clarendon's answer.\nLord Granville had been told not to attend the last Cabinet; Lord\nPalmerston had naturally stayed away.\nI went up to Town at half-past seven to the Westminster Play, and took\nLord John in my train to Richmond. We had some further conversation in\nthe carriage, in which I asked Lord John whether it was true that\nLord Palmerston had got us likewise into a quarrel with America by our\nships firing at Panama upon an American merchantman; he said neither\nhe nor Sir Francis Baring had received any news, but Sir Francis had\nbeen quite relieved by Lord Palmerston's quitting, as he could not be\nsure a moment that his Fleets were not brought into some scrape!\nOn my expressing my conviction that Lord Palmerston could not be very\nformidable to the Government, Lord John said: \"I hope it will not\ncome true what Lord Derby (then Lord Stanley) said after the last\nMinisterial crisis, when Lord John quizzed him at not having been\nable to get a Foreign Secretary--'Next time I shall have Lord\nPalmerston.'!\"\nALBERT.",

For when the revolutionary movements on the Continent\nhad laid prostrate almost all its Governments, and England alone\ndisplayed that order, vigour, and prosperity which it owes to a\nstable, free, and good Government, the Queen, instead of earning the\nnatural good results of such a glorious position, viz. consideration,\ngoodwill, confidence, and influence abroad, obtained the very reverse,\nand had the grief to see her Government and herself treated on many\noccasions with neglect, aversion, distrust, and even contumely.\nFrequently, when our Foreign Policy was called in question, it has\nbeen said by Lord John and his colleagues that the principles on which\nit was conducted were the right ones, and having been approved of\nby them, received their support, and that it was only the _personal\nmanner_ of Lord Palmerston in conducting the affairs which could be\nblamed in tracing the causes which led to the disastrous results the\nQueen complains of.\nThe Queen is certainly not disposed to defend the personal manner in\nwhich Lord Palmerston has conducted Foreign Affairs, but she cannot\nadmit that the errors he committed were merely _faults in form\nand method_, that they were no more than acts of \"inconsideration,\nindiscretion, or bad taste.\" The Queen considers that she has also to\ncomplain of what appeared to her deviations from the principles laid\ndown by the Cabinet for his conduct, nay, she sees distinctly in their\npractical application a _personal and arbitrary perversion_ of the\nvery nature and essence of those principles. She has only to refer\nhere to Italy, Spain, Greece, Holstein, France, etc., etc., which\nafford ample illustrations of this charge.\nIt was one thing for Lord Palmerston to have attempted such\nsubstantial deviations; it will be another for the Cabinet to consider\nwhether they had not the power to check him in these attempts.\nThe Queen, however, considering times to have now changed, thinks that\nthere is no reason why we should any longer confine ourselves to the\nmere assertion of abstract principles, such as \"non-intervention in\nthe internal affairs of other countries,\" \"moral support to liberal\ninstitutions,\" \"protection to British subjects,\" etc., etc. The moving\npowers which were put in operation by the French Revolution of 1848,\nand the events consequent on it, are no longer so obscure; they\nhave assumed distinct and tangible forms in almost all the countries\naffected by them (in France, in Italy, Germany, etc.), and upon the\nstate of things now existing, and the experience gained, the Queen\nwould hope that our Foreign Policy may be _more specifically defined_,\nand that it may be considered how the general principles are to be\npractically adapted to our peculiar relations with each Continental\nState.\nThe Queen wishes therefore that a regular programme embracing these\ndifferent relations should be submitted to her, and would suggest\nwhether it would not be the best mode if Lord John were to ask Lord\nGranville to prepare such a paper and to lay it before her after\nhaving revised it.\nThis would then serve as a safe guide for Lord Granville, and enable\nthe Queen as well as the Cabinet to see that the Policy, as in future\nto be conducted, will be in conformity with the principles laid down\nand approved.",

All that you say about Lord Palmerston is but too true.... He\n_brouill\u00e9d_ us and the country with every one; and his very first\nact precipitated the unfortunate Spanish marriages which was _le\ncommencement de la fin_. It is too grievous to think how much misery\nand mischief might have been avoided. However, now he has done with\nthe Foreign Office for ever, and \"the veteran statesman,\" as the\nnewspapers, to our great amusement and I am sure to _his_ infinite\nannoyance, call him, must rest upon his laurels.... I fear much lest\nthey should be imprudent at Claremont; the poor Queen hinted to Mamma\nthat she hoped you would not become a friend to the President; no\ndoubt you can have no sympathies for him, but _just because_ you\nare related to the poor Orleanses, you feel that you must be doubly\ncautious to do nothing which could provoke the enmity of Louis\nNapoleon. I fear that poor Joinville _had_ some _mad_ idea of going to\nFrance, which, fortunately, his illness prevented. It would have been\nthe height of folly. Their only safe policy is to remain entirely\npassive _et de se faire oublier_, which was Nemours' expression to\nme two years ago; nothing could be wiser or more prudent than he was\nthen--but I don't think they were wise since. _La Candidature_ of\nJoinville was in every way unwise, and led Louis Napoleon to take so\ndesperate a course. Nemours told me also _last_ year that they were\nnot at all against a _fusion_, but that they could not _disposer de la\nFrance_, unless called upon to do so by the nation. I wish you would\ncaution them to be very circumspect and silent--for all the mistakes\nmade by others is in _their_ favour; in fact, no good for them could\ncome till Paris is old enough to be his own master--unless indeed\nthey all returned under Henri V., but a Regency for Paris would be an\nimpossibility....\nWe spent a very happy Christmas, and now wish you a very happy New\nYear--for many succeeding years. Also to the children, who I hope were\npleased with the prints, etc.\nWe have got young Prince Nicholas of Nassau here, a pretty, clever boy\nof nineteen, with a good deal of knowledge, and a great wish to learn\nand hear, which is a rare thing for the young Princes, of our day in\nparticular. I must stop now, as I fear I have already let my pen\nrun on for too long, and must beg to be excused for this voluminous\nletter.\nWith Albert's love ever your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

It makes me very\nmelancholy; I love peace and quiet--in fact, I _hate_ politics and\nturmoil, and I grieve to think that a spark may plunge us into the\nmidst of war. Still I think _that_ may be avoided.

I\nam _very_ curious _how_ they will go off. The curiosity and anxiety to\nhear it is very great.\nI never saw Stockmar better, or more active and more sagacious, or\nmore kind.

I yielded, of course, to such\nan appeal, though there are several points in his speech on which I\ncould have exposed inaccuracies. The fact is, John has never shown any\nconsideration for me in the whole of these affairs; but I do not\nmean in any way to complain, and am very grateful to him for the very\nsuccessful way in which he executed his task on Tuesday. Nothing\ncan be more universal than the feeling of the utter discomfiture of\nPalmerston. I am convinced that what floored him at starting was\nthat letter of the Queen's, because every one felt that such a\nletter would never have been written unless every point in it\ncould have been proved like a bill of indictment; and then came the\nquestion, how could any man, even feeling he deserved it, go on under\nsuch a marked want of confidence?...\nAberdeen, whom I saw at Granville's last night, told me that Cardwell\nhad said to him, that often as he had felt indignant at the arrogance\nof \"that man,\" he really pitied him, so complete was his overthrow.\nDisraeli said that he had watched him during Johnny's speech, and\ndoubted whether the hanging of the head, etc., was merely acting; but\nbefore he had spoken two sentences he saw he was a beaten fox. Many\nsaid that the extreme flippancy and insolence of his manner was\nmore remarkable than ever, from their being evidently assumed with\ndifficulty. I have always thought Palmerston very much overrated as a\nspeaker; his great power arose from his not only knowing his subject\nbetter than any one else, but being the only man who knew anything\nabout it, and using that exclusive knowledge unscrupulously for the\npurposes of misrepresentation.\nThiers was at Lady Granville's last night, and was enchanted with the\nspectacle of the Opening. He said that he had been endeavouring for\nthirty years to support the cause of Constitutional Monarchy, as the\nbest Government in the world, and there he saw it in perfection, not\nonly in its intrinsic attributes, but in the universal respect and\nadhesion with which it was received. He said, though he did not\nunderstand a word of English, he could have cried at the Queen's voice\nin reading the Speech. He is very \"impressionable,\" and I am convinced\nat the time he was quite sincere in his appreciation.\nI am vexed at not having been able to say anything publicly about all\nthis, as I believe I could have dispelled many misrepresentations; but\nit cannot be helped. I have endeavoured throughout not to be selfish,\nand I may as well keep up that feeling to the last. Ever, etc.\nNORMANBY.\nI told John Russell last night I regretted that he had vouched for the\nintentions of Louis Napoleon. He said he had not done that, but owned\nthat he had said more than he ought. \"The fact is, I did not know what\nto say next. I stopped as one sometimes does, so I said that; I had\nbetter have said something else!\" Candid and characteristic!",

Sir James Graham\nand Mr Cardwell had stayed away, but Mr Gladstone and Mr S. Herbert\nhad voted against them, the latter even misrepresenting what Lord\nJohn had said. No Government could stand against incessant motions of\ncensure upon every imaginable department of the Executive Government.\nThe Prime Minister would either have to take the management of all\nthe departments into his own hands, and to be prepared to defend every\nitem, for which he (Lord John) did not feel the moral and physical\npower, or he must succumb on those different points which the\nOpposition with divided labour could single out. Lord Palmerston's\nconduct was the more reprehensible as he had asked him the day before\nabout his objections to the Bill, and had (he thought) satisfied him\nthat the four points upon which he had insisted were provided for in\nthe Bill.\nHe thought he could not (in answer to the Queen's enquiry) dissolve\nParliament, and that Lord Palmerston had no Party. But he supposed\nLord Derby was prepared to form a Protection Government. This\nGovernment would pass the estimates and the Mutiny Bill, and would\nthen have to proceed to a Dissolution. Lord John had merely seen Lord\nLansdowne, who had approved of the course he meant to pursue, though\nafraid of the imputation that the Government had run away from the\nCaffre debate. He had summoned the Cabinet, and would report their\nresolution. Speaking of Lord Palmerston, Lord John said he had heard\nthat Lord Palmerston had said that there was one thing between them\nwhich he could not forgive, and that was his reading the Queen's\nMinute to the House of Commons.\nAt a quarter past four Lord John came back from the Cabinet, and\nformally tendered the resignations of himself and colleagues. The\nCabinet had been unanimous that there was no other course to pursue,\nand that it would not be advisable to make use of the Queen's\npermission to advise a Dissolution. Lord Granville had ascertained\nthrough Dr Quin from Lord Lyndhurst that Lord Derby was prepared with\nan Administration, having obtained Mr Thomas Baring's consent to act\nas Leader of the House of Commons.\nSir Stratford Canning at Constantinople was supposed to be intended\nfor the Foreign Office. Lord Lyndhurst said, though the materials were\nthere, they were very bad ones, and it was a question whether they\nwould stand long. He himself would keep out of place.\nWe advised Lord John to keep his Party well under discipline in\nOpposition, so that whilst there it did not commit errors which\nwould become new difficulties for the future Government. He seemed\ndisinclined for great exertions after the fatigues he had undergone\nthese last years. He said he thought he would not go on with the\nReform Bill out of office, as that was a measure which ought to be\ncarried by a Government. If he had again to propose it, he would very\nlikely alter it a little, reverting to his original plan of taking\naway one Member of the two returned by small boroughs, and giving\ntheir seats to some large towns, counties, and corporations like the\nUniversities, etc.\nLord John defers taking his formal leave till a new Administration is\nformed.\nALBERT.",

    "body": "To-day the formal change of Government took place. The old Ministers\nwho had Seals to give up assembled at half-past eleven, and had their\nAudiences in the following order:\n_Sir George Grey_ was very much overcome; promised at our request to\ndo what he could to keep his friends moderate and united. Spoke well\nof his successor, Mr Walpole, and assured the Queen that he left the\ncountry in a most quiet and contented state.\n_Lord Grey_ was sorry that the resignation had taken place before the\nCaffre Debate, in which he had hoped to make a triumphant defence; he\nwas sure it must have come to this from the way in which Lord John had\nmanaged matters. He had never had his measures thoroughly considered\nwhen he brought them forward. He (Lord Grey) had had to remonstrate\nvery strongly about this Militia Bill, which had not even been laid,\nprinted, before the Cabinet, and had not been discussed at all;\nhe himself had objected to the greater part of it, and had always\nexpected to have an opportunity of making his opinion heard; instead\nof spending Christmas at Woburn he ought to have digested his\nmeasures; this was not fair to his colleagues, and he could never have\nthe same confidence in Lord John as before. We urged him to forget\nwhat had passed and to do the best for the future; that it was\nimportant the Party should be kept together and should unite if\npossible with the Peelites, so that the Queen might hope to get a\nstrong Government. Lord Grey thought there was little chance of this.\nThe next Government could never be as moderate again as this had been;\nthis he had always dreaded, and was the reason why he lamented that\nLord John had failed in his negotiation with the Peelites this winter,\nupon Lord Palmerston's dismissal; but the fact was Lord John had never\nwished it to succeed, and it had been unfair that he had not stated\nto them (the Peelites) that all his colleagues were ready to give up\ntheir places.\n_Lord Granville_ had seen Lord Malmesbury several times, who appeared\nto him to take pains about informing himself on the state of Foreign\nAffairs, but seemed inclined to be ambitious of acquiring the merit of\nbeing exclusively _English_ in his policy; this was quite right, but\nmight be carried too far; however, Lord Malmesbury was cautious and\nmoderate.\n_The Chancellor of the Exchequer_ (_Sir Charles Wood_) was not\nsurprised at the fate of the Government, although they had not\nexpected to be defeated on the Militia Bill; in fact, a division had\nhardly been looked for, as Lord John had talked the day before with\nLord Palmerston, and satisfied him that all his objections should be\nprovided against in the Bill. He thought it was better, however, that\nthe Caffre Debate had not been waited for, which must have been a\npersonal and very acrimonious one. He thought Lord Grey had not been\nvery discreet in his language to the Queen on Lord John. Sir J. Graham\nhad been in a difficulty with his own Party, and therefore had not\nwished to encourage Lord John's negotiation with the Peelites. He\npromised that, for his part, he would do all he could to keep his\nParty from doing anything violent, but that he was afraid many others\nwould be so, and that he and Lord Grey had in vain tried to persuade\nMr Cobden to remain quiet.\nLord Derby had then an Audience to explain what should be done at the\nCouncil. He regretted the Duchess of Northumberland's declining to\nbe Mistress of the Robes, on account of ill-health, which had been\ncommunicated to the Queen by her father, Lord Westminster. He proposed\nthe Duchess of Argyll, whom the Queen allowed to be sounded (though\nfeeling certain, that, considering the Liberal views of her husband,\nshe will not accept it), and sanctioned his sounding also the Duchess\nof Athole, whom the Queen wished to make the offer to, in case the\nDuchess of Argyll declined. Lord Derby stated the difficulty he was\nin with Sir A. B., whose wife had never been received at Court or\nin society, although she had run away with him when he was still at\nschool, and was nearly seventy years old. The Queen said it would\nnot do to receive her now at Court, although society might do in that\nrespect what it pleased; it was a principle at Court not to receive\nladies whose characters are under a stigma.\nWe now proceeded to the Council, which was attended only by three\nCouncillors, the other seventeen having all had to be sworn in as\nPrivy Councillors first.\nAfter the Council Lord Hardinge was called to the Queen, and explained\nthat he accepted the Ordnance only on the condition that he was not\nto be expected to give a vote which would reverse the policy of Sir\nR. Peel, to which he had hitherto adhered. He had thought it his duty,\nhowever, not to refuse his services to the Crown after the many marks\nof favour he had received from the Queen.\nLord Derby then had an Audience to explain what he intended to state\nin Parliament this evening as the programme of his Ministerial Policy.\nIt was very fluent and very able, but so completely the same as the\nSpeech which he has since delivered, that I must refer to its account\nin the reports. When he came to the passage regarding the Church,\nthe Queen expressed to him her sense of the importance not to have\n_Puseyites_ or _Romanisers_ recommended for appointments in the Church\nas bishops or clergymen. Lord Derby declared himself as decidedly\nhostile to the Puseyite tendency, and ready to watch over the\nProtestant character of the Church. He said he did not pretend to give\na decided opinion on so difficult and delicate a point, but it had\nstruck him that although nobody could think in earnest of reviving the\nold Convocation, yet the disputes in the Church perhaps could be most\nreadily settled by some Assembly representing the laity as well as\nthe clergy. I expressed it as my opinion that some such plan would\nsucceed, provided the Church Constitution was built up from the\nbottom, giving the Vestries a legislative character in the parishes\nleading up to Diocesan Assemblies, and finally to a general one.\nOn Education he spoke very liberally, but seemed inclined to support\nthe views of the bishops against the so-called \"management clauses\"\nof the Privy Council, viz. not to allow grants to schools even if\nthe parish should prefer the bishops' inspection to the Privy Council\ninspection.\nALBERT.",

He hoped the Queen did not think\nhe had gone too far in pledging the Crown to a Dissolution about that\ntime; but it was impossible to avoid saying as much as that a new\nParliament would meet in the autumn again, and have settled the\ncommercial policy before Christmas.\nTo the Queen's questions, whether there would not be great excitement\nin the country produced by the General Election, and whether\nParliament ought not to meet immediately after it, he replied that he\nwas not the least afraid of much excitement, and that there was\ngreat advantage in not meeting Parliament immediately again, as the\nGovernment would require a few months to prepare its measures, and to\ntake a sound view of the new position of affairs. He anticipated that\nthere would be returned a large proportion of Conservatives, some Free\nTraders, some Protectionists; but not a majority for the re-imposition\nof a duty on corn, _certainly_ not a majority large enough to justify\nhim in proposing such a Measure. Now he was sure he could not with\nhonour or credit abandon that Measure unless the country had given its\ndecision against it; but then he would have most carefully to consider\nhow to revise the general state of taxation, so as to give that relief\nto the agricultural interest which it had a right to demand.\nHe had received the most encouraging and flattering letters from the\nagriculturists of different parts of the country, all reposing the\nmost explicit confidence in him, and asking him not to sacrifice the\nGovernment for the sake of an immediate return to Protection. They\nfelt what Lord Derby must say he felt himself, that, after the fall of\nthis Government, there would necessarily come one of a more democratic\ntendency than any the country had yet had to submit to. He thought\nmost politicians saw this, and would rally round a Conservative\nstandard; he knew that even many of the leading Whigs were very much\ndissatisfied with the company they find themselves thrown into and\nalarmed at the progress of Democracy.\nALBERT.",

We received the sad news\non an expedition from Allt-na-Giuthasach to the Dhu Loch (one of\nthe wildest and loneliest spots of the Highlands) at four o'clock\nyesterday afternoon. We hurried home to Allt-na-Giuthasach, and to-day\nhere, where it became important to settle with Lord Derby the mode of\nproviding for the command of the Army, and the filling up of the many\nposts and places which the Duke had held.\nI had privately prepared a list of the mode in which this should be\ndone, and discussed it with Victoria, and found, to both Lord Derby's\nand our astonishment, that it tallied in _every_ point with the\nrecommendations which he had thought of making.\nI explained to Lord Derby the grounds upon which I thought it better\nnot to assume the Command myself, and told him of the old Duke's\nproposal, two years ago, to prepare the way to my assuming the Command\nby the appointment of a Chief of the Staff, on Sir Willoughby Gordon's\ndeath, and the reasons on which I then declined the offer. Lord Derby\nentirely concurred in my views, and seemed relieved by my explanation;\nwe then agreed that for the loss of _authority_ which we had lost with\nthe Duke, we could only make up by increase in _efficiency_ in the\nappointments to the different offices. That Lord Hardinge was the only\nman fit to command the Army.\nHe should then receive the Command-in-Chief. The Ordnance which\nhe would vacate should be given to Lord Fitzroy Somerset,\nhitherto Military Secretary (with the offer of a peerage). The\nConstableship of the Tower to Lord Combermere; the Garter to Lord\nLondonderry; the Grenadier Guards and the Rifle Brigade to me; the\nFusiliers vacated by me to the Duke of Cambridge (or the Coldstream,\nLord Strafford exchanging to the Fusiliers); the 60th Rifles vacated\nby me to Lord Beresford; the Rangership of the Parks in London to\nGeorge (Duke of Cambridge); the Wardenship of the Cinque Ports to Lord\nDalhousie; the Lieutenancy of Hampshire to Lord Winchester. I reserved\nto me the right of considering whether I should not assume the command\nof the Brigade of Guards which the Duke of York held in George IV.'s\ntime, to which William IV. appointed himself, and which has been\nvacant ever since Victoria's accession, although inherent to the\nConstitution of the Guards.\nLord Derby had thought of George for the Command-in-Chief, as an\nalternative for Lord Hardinge, but perceived that his rank as\na Major-General and youth would hardly entitle him to such an\nadvancement. He would have carried no weight with the public, and we\nmust not conceal from ourselves that many attacks on the Army which\nhave been sleeping on account of the Duke will now be forthcoming.\nVictoria wishes the Army to mourn for the Duke as long as for a member\nof the Royal Family.\nLord Derby proposes a public funeral, which cannot take place,\nhowever, before the meeting of Parliament in November. He is to find\nout how this is to be accomplished on account of the long interval.\nThe correspondence here following shows what doubts exist as to\nthe person in whom the Command of the Army is vested in case of a\nvacancy. I consider Lord Palmerston's letter as a mere attempt\nto arrogate supreme power for his Office, which rests on no\nfoundation. The Secretary at War has no authority whatever except over\nmoney, whilst the Commander-in-Chief has no authority to spend a penny\nwithout the Secretary at War.\nALBERT.",

The only case in which we were\nat variance was about the boundaries of Greece. He had some of the old\nabsolute notions, which in that case were not in conformity with the\nreal interests of England and of Europe.

But the gracious approbation with which his\nservices here have been viewed was a sufficient motive for continuing\nthem for some time longer, if they were thought profitable to the\nState.\nYour Majesty has very recently been pleased to bestow upon him a still\nfurther distinction, which calls not merely for the expression of his\ndeep and humble gratitude to your Majesty, but for a further devotion\nto your Majesty's service of whatever power he may possess for\npromoting its interests.\nThat your Majesty should prefer him at all to an Office of such\ntraditional distinction as the Wardenship was an honour to which the\nGovernor-General would never at any time have dreamt of aspiring.

In the\nmountains of Nepaul the same sad tribute was rendered by the Maharajah\nas by ourselves, while in Mysore the Rajah not only fired minute\nguns in his honour, but even caused the Dusserah, the great Hindoo\nfestival, to be stopped throughout the city, in token of his grief.\nExcepting the usual disturbance from time to time among the still\nuntamed mountain tribes upon our north-western border, there is entire\ntranquillity in India.

He was present at a dinner of the Peelite Party\nyesterday at Mr Wortley's, when Speeches were made, and language held\nabout the reunion of the Conservative Party, resulting, however, in\na declaration that if your Majesty's servants did not accept Lord\nPalmerston's Amendment, they, as a body, would vote in favour of Mr\nVilliers. Lord Derby has been farther informed that they are willing\nto join the Government, but that one of their conditions would be\nthat Lord Palmerston should lead the House of Commons, Mr Gladstone\nrefusing to serve under Mr Disraeli. This, if true, does not look like\nan absence of all concert.\nTo complete the general confusion of Parties, the Duke of Bedford, who\ncalled on Lady Derby this morning, assures her that Lord John Russell\ndoes not desire the fall of your Majesty's present Government, and\nthat in no case will he enter into any combination with the Radical\nParty, a declaration quite at variance with the course he has pursued\nsince Parliament met.\nOf course Lord Derby, in these circumstances, has not taken any step\nwhatever towards exercising the discretion with which your Majesty was\ngraciously pleased to entrust him this morning. He much regrets\nhaving to send your Majesty so unsatisfactory a statement, and has\ndesired to have the latest intelligence sent up to him of what may\npass in the House of Commons, and he will endeavour to keep your\nMajesty informed of any new occurrence which any hour may produce.\n_Half-past six._\nLord Derby has just heard from the House of Commons that Sir James\nGraham has given the history of the framing of the Amendment, and has\nexpressed his intention, if Lord Palmerston's Amendment be accepted,\nto advise Mr Villiers to withdraw. Mr Gladstone has held the same\nlanguage; there appears to be much difference of opinion, but Lord\nDerby would think that the probable result will be the adoption of\nLord Palmerston's proposition. He fears this will lead to a good deal\nof discontent among the supporters of the Government; but a different\ncourse would run imminent risk of defeat.",

On my question why Mr Gladstone could\nnot lead, he replied that Mr Gladstone was, in his opinion, quite\nunfit for it; he had none of that decision, boldness, readiness, and\nclearness which was necessary to lead a Party, to inspire it with\nconfidence, and, still [more], to take at times a decision on the spur\nof the moment, which a leader had often to do. Then he said that\nhe could not in honour sacrifice Mr Disraeli, who had acted very\nstraightforwardly to him as long as they had had anything to do with\neach other, and who possessed the confidence of his followers. Mr\nDisraeli had no idea of giving up the lead.\nWe could quite understand, on the other hand, that the colleagues of\nSir Robert Peel could not feel inclined to serve under Mr Disraeli.\nUnder these circumstances we agreed that nothing should be done at\npresent, and that it must be left to time to operate changes, that\nmuch must depend upon the success which Mr Disraeli may have with his\nBudget, and that the knowledge that Lord Palmerston could not obtain\nthe lead would oblige those who wished to join to think of a different\ncombination.\nLord Derby owned (upon my blunt question) that he did not think Mr\nDisraeli had ever had a strong feeling, one way or the other, about\nProtection or Free Trade, and that he would make a very good Free\nTrade Minister.\nThe Queen was anxious to know what Lord Derby thought Lord George\nBentinck (if now alive) would do in this conjunction.

The responsibility of having produced this\neffect would rest personally with the Queen, who might be accused of\nhaving brought it about, influenced by personal feelings of animosity\nagainst the Emperor, or by mistaken friendship for the Orleans family,\nor misplaced family pride, etc., etc., etc. The acceptance of the\nproposal, on the other hand, or even the consummation of the project\nwithout her _direct_ intervention, cannot fail to expose the Queen\nto a share in the just opprobrium attaching in the eyes of all\nright-thinking men to the political acts perpetrated in France ever\nsince 2nd December 1851. And, while it would appear as if her Family\ndid not care for any such considerations, so long as by an alliance\nthey could secure momentary advantages, it would give the other\nPowers of Europe, whom the Emperor seems to be disposed to treat\nvery unceremoniously (as shown by Lord Cowley's last reports) the\nimpression that England suddenly had separated herself from them, and\nbound herself to France for a family interest pursued by the Queen.\nThese are the dangers to \"the Queen's personal character,\" which\npresented themselves to her mind when she wrote her last letter, and\nwhich Lord Derby says remained unintelligible to him.\nThe Queen wishes Lord Derby to show this letter to Lord Malmesbury,\nwhom, under the circumstances, she thinks it best not to address\nseparately.

He complained of the\nfactiousness of the Opposition, which he and his Party hoped,\nhowever, not to imitate; was ready to support, as far as he could,\nany Administration which was sincerely anxious to check the growth of\ndemocracy. He said his calculations at the close of the Elections\nhad been found almost to a man verified in the late vote: 286 members\nvoting with the Government, and these were their regular supporters;\nthe other half of the House was composed of 150 Radicals, 50 of the\nso-called Irish Brigade, 120 Whigs, and 30 Peelites. It was clear\nthat, if all these combined, he would be outvoted, though none of\nthese Parties alone numbered as much as half of his. However, he had\nheard lately from good authority that the Whigs and Peelites had\ncome to an agreement, and were ready to form an Administration on\nConservative principles, to the exclusion of the Radicals, under the\nlead of Lord Aberdeen. Although only 150 strong, they thought, that\nwith all the talent they had at their command, they would be able to\nobtain the confidence of the country, and hold the balance between the\ntwo extreme Parties in the House. He felt that after having failed to\nobtain the confidence of Parliament himself, he could do nothing\nelse than retire at once, and he advised the Queen to send for Lord\nLansdowne, who knew better than anybody the state of Parties, and\nwould give the best advice. He did not advise the Queen to send for\nLord Aberdeen at once, because, if it were reported that he had given\nthis advice, many of his Party--who had already been distressed at\nhis declaration to them that if he was defeated he would withdraw from\npublic life--would think it necessary to join Lord Aberdeen as their\nnew appointed leader; and then the other half, which felt the deepest\nindignation at the treatment they had received from the Peelites,\nwould throw themselves into a reckless alliance with the Radicals, to\nrevenge themselves upon the new Government, so the great Conservative\nParty would be broken up, which it was so essential for the country to\nkeep together and moderate.\nI interrupted Lord Derby, saying that, constitutionally speaking, it\ndid not rest with him to give advice and become responsible for it,\nand that nobody therefore could properly throw the responsibility of\nthe Queen's choice of a new Minister upon him; the Queen had thought\nof sending for Lord Lansdowne and Lord Aberdeen together. This, Lord\nDerby said, would do very well; he knew that, strictly speaking, the\nSovereign acted upon her own responsibility, but it was always said on\nsuch occasions, for instance, \"Lord John advised the Queen to send for\nLord Derby,\" etc., etc.\nHe then gave it rather jokingly as his opinion that he thought less\nthan 32 could hardly be the number of the new Cabinet, so many former\nMinisters would expect to be taken in; the Whigs said 36. Lord John\nRussell was designated for the Home Office, Lord Canning for the\nForeign, Mr Gladstone for the Colonial Department, Lord Clanricarde\nfor the Post Office, Lord Granville for Ireland.

It\nwould now depend upon the decision of the Queen whom she would charge\nwith the formation of a Government. The Queen answered that she\nthought Lord Lansdowne was too old and infirm to undertake such\narduous duties, and that she commissioned Lord Aberdeen. He replied\nhe was fully aware of his own unworthiness for the task, and had\nexpressed his disinclination to Lord Lansdowne, while Lord Lansdowne,\non the other hand, had pressed him to take the responsibility himself;\nbut since the Queen had commissioned him, he wished to say that it was\nof the greatest importance that only one person should be charged with\nthe task and be responsible for it, and that the new Government should\nnot be a revival of the old Whig Cabinet with an addition of some\nPeelites, but should be a liberal Conservative Government in the\nsense of that of Sir Robert Peel; he thought this would meet with\nthe confidence of the country, even if excluding the Radicals. Lord\nAberdeen said he meant to propose to the Queen Lord John Russell as\nLeader of the House of Commons and Secretary of State for Foreign\nAffairs, which _he_ thinks he would accept. (The Queen sanctioned\nthis.) He would then consult Lord John upon his appointments, but\nhe (Lord Aberdeen) would be responsible, taking care that Lord John\nshould be satisfied. There was no doubt that Lord John had full claims\nto be Prime Minister again, but that he could give him no greater\nproof of confidence, having been his opponent all his life, than to\ngive him the lead of the House of Commons, which made him virtually\nas much Prime Minister as he pleased, and the Foreign Office combined\nwith it would satisfy Lord John as following the precedent of Mr Fox.\nThe Peelites would not have served under Lord Lansdowne, much less\nunder Lord John; but a great many Whigs even objected to Lord John.\nThis was a temporary and undeserved unpopularity, and still Lord John\nremained the first man in the country, and might be Prime Minister\nagain. The Peelites would know and learn to respect him when meeting\nhim in office. Lord Aberdeen hoped even many Conservatives now going\nwith Lord Derby would support such a Government, but to preserve to\nit a Conservative character, two Secretaries of State at least must be\n_Peelites_.\nWe next talked of Lord Palmerston, whom we agreed it would be\nimprudent to leave to combine in opposition with Mr Disraeli. Lord\nAberdeen had thought of Ireland for him; we felt sure he would not\naccept that. I gave Lord Aberdeen a list of the possible distribution\nof offices, which I had drawn up, and which he took with him as\ncontaining \"valuable suggestions.\" He hoped the Queen would allow him\nto strengthen himself in the House of Lords, where there was nobody to\ncope with Lord Derby, by the translation of Sir James Graham or Mr\nS. Herbert, if he should find this necessary. Sir James might gain in\nmoving from the House of Commons, as he lately fettered himself with\ninconvenient Radical pledges. He felt he would have great difficulty\nin the formation of his Government, for although everybody promised to\nforget his personal wishes and interests, yet when brought to the test\nsuch professions were often belied. The difficulty of measures lies\nchiefly in the Budget, as the Income Tax would have to be settled,\nand he was anxious to keep a good surplus. As to Reform, he felt that,\nconsidering the Queen to have recommended it by a Speech from the\nThrone, and Lord John to have actually introduced a Measure as Prime\nMinister, the door could not be closed against it; but it might be\npostponed for the present, and there was no real wish for it in the\ncountry.\nHe was very sorry that the Government had been upset, and if the\nBudget had been such that it could have been accepted he should much\nhave preferred it. Lord Derby seemed very much offended with him\npersonally for his speech in the House of Lords. Lord Aberdeen kissed\nhands, and started again at four o'clock.",

He feels the full extent of\nthose difficulties, and he may perhaps be forgiven if he entertains a\nstrong opinion that a due appreciation of their magnitude might have\nbeen expected to have some weight with those Conservative statesmen,\nwhose opposition thrown into the adverse scale turned the balance\nagainst your Majesty's servants, and rendered their retirement from\noffice inevitable. Lord Derby does not affect to deny that he thinks\nhe has some reason, personally and politically, to find fault with the\ncourse which they have pursued: but to suffer any such consideration\nto influence his public conduct, with regard to the Government now in\nprocess of formation, would be entirely at variance with his sense of\npublic duty, and inconsistent with the deep gratitude which he must\never feel for the confidence with which your Majesty has honoured him.\nLord Derby confesses himself at a loss to understand in what manner\nLord Aberdeen can be enabled to reconcile the many and serious\ndiscrepancies, in matters both of Church and State, which would appear\nto exist among his presumed future colleagues; but it will give him\nunfeigned satisfaction to see these difficulties surmounted in such\na sense as to enable him to give to the Government his independent\nsupport; and in the meantime it is his determination honestly to\nundertake the task, difficult as it must be, of keeping together a\npowerful Party, without the excitement of opposition to a Government\nby which their own leaders have been superseded, and of some members\nof which they think they have reason to complain; and even to\ninduce that Party to give it their support, whenever they can do so\nconsistently, with their own conscientious convictions.",

Lord\nLansdowne, who had been throughout very kind in his exertions to bring\nabout the junction of Parties, was now engaged to prevail upon him\nto take the Home Office. We congratulated Lord Aberdeen upon this\nsymptom, which augured confidence in his success. Lord Aberdeen said\nthat when he saw Lord Palmerston, who then declined office, nothing\ncould have exceeded the expressions of his cordiality; he had even\nreminded him that in fact they were great friends (!!!) of sixty\nyears' standing, having been at school together. We could not help\nlaughing heartily at the _Harrow Boys_ and their friendship. The\nForeign Office Lord John had again positively refused, contrary to the\nadvice of all his friends, and to please Lady John. This arrangement\nfailing, Lord Clarendon was to undertake it, but Lord Clarendon was\nnow gone himself to try to persuade Lord, or rather Lady, John to\naccept--at least temporarily--declaring his readiness to take it\noff his hands at any time if he should find the work too heavy. Lord\nAberdeen had no hope, however, of Lord Clarendon's success. Then\nthere would come the grave Constitutional Question of establishing the\nnovelty of a Leader in the House of Commons who held no office. Lord\nJohn had seen the danger of being exposed to the reproach that he had\nslipped into office without having gone through the popular ordeal\nof a re-election, and had proposed to obviate this by accepting\nthe Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds, and then having himself\nre-elected for the City of London. But this would not meet all the\nobjections, for it would still be considered unconstitutional that\nhe should lead the business of the Government in the House of Commons\nwithout the responsibility of office. The Leader of the House of\nCommons was an irresponsible person, and Lord John's saying: \"I shall\nrepresent you (Lord Aberdeen) in the House of Commons,\" would be\nequally unconstitutional. Lord John must therefore be prevailed upon\nto take the Chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster, though he\nfelt no inclination to become the successor of Mr Christopher. Lord\nAberdeen read a Memorandum of Lord John's, containing his political\nviews on the crisis and the principles of the new Government, of which\nhe is to send the Queen a copy.\n_For the Colonial Office._--Lord Aberdeen wavered between Sir J.\nGraham and Mr Gladstone; either could be this, or Chancellor of the\nExchequer. Lord John wished Sir James as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\nWe argued the greater capabilities of Sir James for the Administration\nof the Colonies, and Mr Gladstone for the Finances.\n_Chancellor of the Exchequer_--therefore, Mr Gladstone.\n  _Admiralty_--Mr Sidney Herbert.\n  _Board of Control_--Sir C. Wood.\n  _Board of Trade_--Lord Granville.\n  _Board of Works_--Sir F. Baring.\n(Baring and Wood being the two men whom Lord John had insisted on\nhaving on the Treasury Bench sitting by his side.)\n_Postmaster_--Lord Canning.\n  _Secretary-at-War_--Mr Cardwell.\nThese would form the Cabinet. Upon Ireland no decision had been\ncome to, though Lord Granville was generally pointed out as the best\nLord-Lieutenant.\nLord Aberdeen was very much pleased with the entire confidence\nexisting between him and Lord John. The Budget would be a formidable\ndifficulty, as in fact the Government would be an Income Tax\nGovernment.\nLord Derby's intemperate and unconstitutional behaviour would do\nno good to the Government; many of his friends were disgusted. Lord\nClanwilliam had called his speech in the House of Lords \"a great\noutrage.\" The Radicals might be conciliated in some of the lower\nOffices by the appointment of Mr Charles Villiers, Sir William\nMolesworth, and others.",

One thing only distressed him in taking leave, and that\nwas the idea that the Queen might think he had unnecessarily raised\ndifficulties to the formation of a new Government by his Speech in\nthe House of Lords. Now, it had been incumbent upon him to show to\nhis Party that he had not quitted office on light grounds, after the\nsacrifices of opinion they had brought in order to support him; he had\nto prove that the vote in the House of Commons was not an accidental\nvote, but the preconcerted Union of all Parties (in opposition)\nagainst him, which gave them a real majority. We replied that it was\nnot his opinion on the late division, to the expression of which the\nQueen had objected, but to that of an opinion on the character of\nthe new Government which the Queen had not yet formed. It was of the\ngreatest importance to keep that in suspense, and the declaration that\nLord Derby knew Lord Aberdeen to profess Conservative opinions of his\nown (Lord Derby's) shade, had at once given the alarm to the Radicals,\nand made them insist upon a greater proportion of Liberals in the\nCabinet.

How could Lord Aberdeen and Lord John Russell agree\nupon the Foreign Policy, for instance?

At the General Election, however, it appeared to him\nthat there was such a total want of principle in him and his Party,\npledging themselves for Protection in one place and Free Trade in\nanother, and appearing consistent only on one point, viz. their hatred\nto Sir Robert Peel's memory and his friends, that he became determined\nto have nothing to do with them.\nThe formation of the Government appeared to give satisfaction to the\ncountry, though of course the number of the disappointed must be even\nlarger than usual on such occasions. Lord Canning seemed very much\nhurt at not being taken into the Cabinet, and felt inclined to refuse\nthe Post Office.

We\nasked what Lord Palmerston had been about during the crisis? Lord John\ntold us in reply that Lord Palmerston had certainly been disposed\nto join Lord Derby's Government, but always said he could not do so\nalone; that if eight of them were to join, then they would have the\nmajority in the Cabinet. He also said that he believed Lord Palmerston\nwould have voted _for_ some parts of the Budget and against others.\nLord John does not think that that large Party of Lord Derby's will\nlong keep together, that some would vote for the Government, others\nmight try to raise a Protestant cry.\nLord Palmerston looked excessively ill, and had to walk with two\nsticks from the gout.",

    "body": "DEAREST MADAME,--I fear that I shall not be able to add much to the\nnewspaper account of yesterday's ceremony, for it was one the\nimpression of which is best conveyed by a simple and accurate\ndescription of the scene, and of those arrangements and details which\ncombined to render its effect gorgeous and dazzling. Apart, however,\nfrom the historical interest attached to it as one of the very curious\nacts of the extraordinary Drama now enacting in France, the impression\nproduced was one that would be called forth by a magnificent\ntheatrical representation, and little more. This seemed to be the\npublic feeling, for though multitudes thronged the streets, the day\nbeing dry, they appeared to be animated by curiosity chiefly, and that\n_sober_ curiosity which now characterises the people of Paris, wearied\nas they are of _novelty_ and excitement. As far as one can judge,\nit does not seem that the lower orders take much interest in this\nmarriage; the ambition and vanity of _his_ partisans have been wounded\nby it, and, of course, his enemies do not scruple to calumniate and\nslander the unfortunate object of his choice disgracefully.\nIt is very difficult to ascertain anything like truth as regards her,\nbut her beauty and engaging manners will, it is thought by many, gain\nfor her, for a time at least, a greater amount of popularity than his\nfriends who now blame the marriage expect. That he is passionately in\nlove with her no one doubts, and his countenance on late occasions, as\nwell as yesterday, wore a radiant and joyous expression very unusual.\nShe, on the contrary, showed a considerable amount of nervousness at\nthe Civil Marriage, and was as pale as death yesterday--however, even\nwith the high and determined spirit she is supposed to have, this\nmight be expected. Lady Cowley had been kind enough to send us an\ninvitation, of which we were tempted to avail ourselves. Nothing\ncould be more splendid than the decorations of the Cathedral--velvet\nand ermine--gold and silver--flags and hangings of all colours were\ncombined and harmonised with the splendid costumes of the Clergy,\nthe uniforms, civil and military, and the magnificent dresses of the\nladies. The greatest mistake was the _conflict_ of lights--the windows\nnot having been darkened, though countless thousands of wax candles\nwere lighted. The music was very fine.... The object of our neighbours\nseemed to be to scan and criticise the dress of the Bride, and the\nwonderful penetration and accuracy of their eagle glances was to us\nsomething incredible! Certainly, though unable ourselves at such a\ndistance to appreciate the details of her dress or the expression of\nher countenance, we saw her distinctly enough to be able to say that\na more lovely _coup d'[oe]il_ could not be conceived. Her beautifully\nchiselled features and marble complexion, her nobly _set-on head_,\nher exquisitely proportioned figure and graceful carriage were most\nstriking, and the whole was like a Poet's Vision! I believe she is\nequally beautiful when seen close, but at a distance at which we saw\nher the effect was something more than that of a lovely picture, it\nwas aerial, ideal. On the classically shaped head she wore a diamond\ncrown or diadem, round her waist a row of magnificent diamonds to\ncorrespond, and the same as trimming round the \"basques\" of her gown.\nThen a sort of cloud or mist of transparent lace enveloped her,\nwhich had the effect of that for which, when speaking of the hills in\nScotland, Princess Hohenlohe could find no English word, \"_Duft_.\" I\nhope your Royal Highness will not think me very much carried by what\npleases the eye. I felt all the while that one could view the matter\nbut as an outside show; as such, in as far as she was concerned,\nit was exquisitely beautiful--and I suppose that a sort of national\nprejudice made me attribute the grace and dignity of the scene,\nfor what there was of either came from her, to the blood of\n_Kirkpatrick!!!_\nThe carriages were ugly and the Procession by no means fine, and\nthose in which the Bridal party afterwards travelled to St Cloud,\nwere driven by individuals in the famous theatrical costume of the\nwell-known \"Postillon de Longjumeau!\"",

Since I wrote to you _le grand \u00e9v\u00e9nement a eu lieu!_ We\ntruly live in times where at least variety is not wanting; the only\nmischief is that like drunkards people want more and more excitement,\nand it therefore will probably end by what remains the most exciting\nof all--War. Amusing and interesting war is, it must be confessed,\nmore than anything in the world, and that makes me think that it\nmust be the bouquet when people will be _blas\u00e9_ of everything else.\nI enclose a letter from our Secretary of Legation at Madrid, Baron\nBeyens, who married a great friend of the Queen, Mademoiselle de Santa\nCruz, and is much _au fait_ of all things that interest the public\njust now. It seems by what I learned from Paris that the Empress\ncommunicated to a friend a communication of _son cher \u00e9poux_ when\nshe expressed her sense of her elevation to such eminence; as it may\ninterest you and Albert, I will make an extract of it here: \"Vous ne\nme parlez, ma ch\u00e8re enfant, que des avantages de la position que je\nvous offre, mais mon devoir est de vous signaler aussi ses dangers;\nils sont grands, je serai sans doute \u00e0 vos c\u00f4t\u00e9s l'objet de plus d'une\ntentative d'assassinat; ind\u00e9pendamment de cela, je dois vous confier\nque des complots s\u00e9rieux se fomentent dans l'arm\u00e9e. J'ai l'[oe]il\nouvert de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 et je compte bien d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'autre pr\u00e9venir\ntoute explosion; le moyen sera _peut-\u00eatre la guerre_. L\u00e0 encore il y a\nde grandes chances de ruine pour moi. Vous voyez donc bien que vous\nne devez pas avoir de scrupules pour partager mon sort, les mauvaises\nchances \u00e9tant peut-\u00eatre \u00e9gales aux bonnes!\"\nI was sorry to hear of Lord Melbourne's, _i.e._, Beauvale's, death.\nI knew him since 1814, and found him always very kind. For poor Lady\nMelbourne, who devoted herself so much, it is a sad blow. We are\nlonging for a little cold, but it does not come though we have some\neast wind. I am held back in some of the _most essential_ measures for\nthe defence of the country by the tricks of the Chamber. I see that\nthe Manchester party shines in unusual Bright-ness and Cobden-ness by\na degress of absurdity never as yet heard of. In the American War the\nQuakers refused to fight; they did not besides like the extremities\nthe States had gone to against the mother country; but not to defend\nits own country against probable invasion is truly too much.\nPray have the goodness to give my best love to Albert, and believe me,\never my dearest Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

The manners are excellent and free from pompousness or\nawkwardness of any kind, simple, and when he is graciously disposed,\nas he was to me, _sehr herzlich und nat\u00fcrlich_. He keeps every one\nin great order without requiring for this an _outr\u00e9_ appearance of\nauthority, merely because he is the master, and there is that about\nhim which gives authority, and which sometimes those _who have the\nauthority cannot succeed in getting accepted or in practising_.

We were several times surrounded by people of all\nclasses, and he certainly quite at their mercy, but I never saw his\nlittle _muthig_ expression changed either by being pleased or alarmed.\nI trust that this family connection may mitigate the only impression\nwhich in Austria has created a hostile feeling, viz. the suspicions\nin Palmerston's time that it had become a plan of England _to\ndestroy_ the Austrian Empire.

Trusting to your\nMajesty's gracious condescension, and the confidence with which Lord\nAberdeen has been honoured, he will humbly venture to lay before your\nMajesty, without any reserve, the motives which have induced him to\noffer this advice to your Majesty.\nThe situation of Lord Palmerston is peculiar. Unless he should\ncontinue to be a cordial member of your Majesty's Government, he may\nvery easily become the leader of Opposition. Lord Aberdeen is at this\nmoment ignorant of his real views and intentions. He has been recently\nmore than once thwarted in his endeavours to press a hostile policy\nupon the Cabinet; and it has been reported to Lord Aberdeen that he\nhas expressed himself in terms of great hostility. This cannot perhaps\nbe avoided, and is only the result of taking different views of the\npublic interest; but it is very essential that Lord Palmerston should\nhave no personal or private cause of complaint against Lord Aberdeen.\nFrom his office of Home Secretary he might naturally expect to have\nthe honour of attending your Majesty; and should this not be the\ncase he might probably resent it and attribute it to the jealousy and\nill-will of Lord Aberdeen. But whether he did this, or not, himself,\nthe Public and the Press would not fail to do so, and would convert\nthis neglect into the ground of the most hostile and bitter attacks.\nYour Majesty may perhaps be aware that there is no amount of flattery\nwhich is not offered to Lord Palmerston by the Tory party, with the\nhope of separating him altogether from the Government.\nLord Aberdeen fully admits that this step which he has humbly proposed\nto your Majesty may fail to produce any good effect, and that it may\neven be turned hereafter to the injury of the Government; but, at\nall events, Lord Aberdeen's conscience will be clear; and if Lord\nPalmerston has any generous feelings, it is not impossible that he\nmay appreciate favourably a proceeding which cannot but afford him\npersonal satisfaction.",

The meeting was very long, and\nconsiderable difference of opinion prevailed in the course of the\ndiscussion. At length, however, Lord Aberdeen is happy to say there\nwas such an agreement as ensured a certain degree of unanimity. With\nthis view, it was determined to adhere to a defensive principle\nof action in the East. The Fleets may perhaps be already at\nConstantinople; but, at all events, they are to be brought there\nforthwith, and to be stationed either there or in the Bosphorus,\nunless the Russians should cross the Danube, or make any attack upon\nthe Turkish possessions on the coast of the Black Sea. In this case,\nthe combined Fleets would enter the Black Sea, for the defence of the\nTurkish territory.\nConsidering the position we have already assumed in this unfortunate\naffair, perhaps it was impossible to do less than this; and as there\nis very little chance of Russia undertaking any active hostilities\nof the nature apprehended, it may reasonably be hoped that no actual\ncollision will take place. At the same time it must be recollected\nthat Russia will regard the entrance of line of battle-ships into the\nBlack Sea as a virtual declaration of war against herself.\nThere is yet no confirmation of the actual declaration of war by\nthe Porte, and although there is no reason to suspect any serious\nimpediment to the decision of the Divan being fulfilled, it is rather\nstrange that intelligence to this effect has not been received. If\nLord Stratford should see great cause for apprehension at the prospect\nof the Turks in the prosecution of hostilities, it is just possible\nthat by his influence he may have arrested the progress of their\nwarlike measures; but probably this is too much to hope. At all\nevents, Lord Aberdeen trusts that the path of negotiation is not\nfinally closed, and that, notwithstanding the equivocal position of\nGreat Britain in this contest, it may still be possible to employ\nwords of conciliation and peace....",

It was evident that Lord Aberdeen was, against his\nbetter judgment, consenting to a course of policy which he inwardly\ncondemned, that his desire to maintain unanimity at the Cabinet led\nto concessions which by degrees altered the whole character of the\npolicy, while he held out no hope of being able permanently to secure\nagreement. I described the Queen's position as a very painful one.\nHere were decisions taken by the Cabinet, perhaps even acted upon,\ninvolving the most momentous consequences, without her previous\nconcurrence or even the means for her to judge of the propriety or\nimpropriety of course to be adopted, with evidence that the Minister,\nin whose judgment the Queen placed her chief reliance, disapproved\nof it. The position was morally and constitutionally a wrong one. The\nQueen ought to have the whole policy in spirit and ultimate tendency\ndeveloped before her to give her deliberate sanction to it, knowing\nwhat it involved her in abroad and at home. She might now be involved\nin war, of which the consequences could not be calculated, chiefly by\nthe desire of Lord Aberdeen to keep his Cabinet together; this might\nthen break down, and the Queen would be left without an efficient\nGovernment, and a war on her hands. Lord Aberdeen renounced one of his\nchief sources of strength in the Cabinet, by not making it apparent\nthat he requires the sanction of the Crown to the course proposed by\nthe Cabinet, and has to justify his advice by argument before it can\nbe adopted, and that it does not suffice to come to a decision at the\ntable of the Cabinet. Sir James Graham perfectly coincided with this\nview and offered to go up to Town immediately. The Queen wrote the\nletter to Lord Aberdeen ... which Sir James takes up with him. He\nshall arrive at Windsor on Friday (14th), and Lord Aberdeen is to have\nan Audience on Saturday. Sir James will tell him that the Queen wants\nhis deliberate opinion on what course is best to be followed, and\nthat the course once adopted should be steadily and uninterruptedly\npursued.\nALBERT.",

She has now received and read the Despatches, which have\nin the meantime been sent off to their points of destination without\nhaving received her sanction!\nThe draft to Vienna the Queen thinks very ably argued, and justly to\ndefine the present position of the question at issue.\nThe instructions to Lord Stratford, on the other hand, appear to\nher very vague, and entrusting him with enormous powers and a latitude\nof discretion which is hardly to be called safe. As matters have now\nbeen arranged, it appears to the Queen, moreover, that we have taken\non ourselves in conjunction with France all the risks of a European\nwar, without having bound Turkey to any conditions with respect to\nprovoking it. The hundred and twenty fanatical Turks constituting the\nDivan at Constantinople are left sole judges of the line of policy\nto be pursued, and made cognisant at the same time of the fact\nthat England and France have bound themselves to defend the Turkish\nTerritory!

The Emperor complained bitterly of the conduct\nof the Powers, who had disgraced him before the world by making him\naccept a Note, and sanctioning its alteration by Turkey; \"now they\nshould do what they pleased and settle matters with Turkey first, and\nbring him only what was settled and fixed, he was wearied of the whole\nbusiness, and anxious to get rid of it for ever.\"\nWhat Lord Aberdeen now proposed was to follow the Emperor's advice and\nagree with Turkey upon a Note, leaving out all that she had objected\nto in the Vienna Note as Lord Stratford recommended, and taking as\nmuch as possible Redschid Pasha's own words to found the proposal of\nit upon the declaration made by the Emperor at Olm\u00fctz to the Powers,\nthat he sought for _no new_ right, privilege, or advantage, but solely\nfor the confirmation of the legal _status quo_, but accompanying this\nwith a declaration, that if Turkey created needless difficulties and\ntried to evade a peaceful settlement the Powers would withdraw their\nsupport and leave her to fight her own battle. We went over the\nDocuments which are not yet settled, even between Lord Aberdeen\nand Lord Clarendon, and will require the greatest caution in their\nwording. It is evident that the Turks have every inducement not to\nlet this opportunity slip in going to war with Russia, as they will\nprobably never find so advantageous a one again, as the whole of\nChristendom has declared them in the right, and they would fight with\nEngland and France actively on their side!\nAt home, Lord Aberdeen said matters do not stand much better. Lord\nJohn has convinced himself that, under present circumstances it\nwould not do for him to ask Lord Aberdeen to retire from the Prime\nMinistership and let him step in in his place; perhaps he has found\nout also that the Peelites will not serve under him; his own Whig\ncolleagues would very much regret if not object to such a change, and\nthat Lord Palmerston could not well submit to the arrangement. So\nhe told Lord Aberdeen that he had given up that idea; it was clear,\nhowever, that he was now looking for an opportunity to break up the\nGovernment on some popular ground, which it was impossible to hope\nthat he should not find. He now had asked for the immediate summoning\nof Parliament, called for by the state of the Oriental Question. This\nwould create the greatest alarm in the country, and embarrassment to\nthe Government, and was therefore resisted. Lord Aberdeen told Lord\nJohn quite plainly he knew what the proposal meant--he meant to break\nup the Government. \"I hope not,\" was Lord John's laughing reply.\nThe Queen taxed Lord Aberdeen with imprudence in talking to Lord\nJohn of his own readiness to leave office, which he acknowledged, but\ncalled _very natural_ in a man of seventy. Lord John was dissatisfied\nwith his position;... upon Lord Aberdeen telling him that he had the\nmost powerful and honourable position of any man in England as leader\nof the House of Commons, he answered, \"Oh, _there_ I am quite happy!\"\nI asked how under such circumstances that all-important measure of\nParliamentary Reform, upon which the future stability and well-being\nof the Country so much depended, was to be matured and brought\nforward? Lord Aberdeen replied that Lord John had it all ready and\nprepared in his pocket, and told Lord Aberdeen so, adding, however,\nthat under present circumstances there was no use in bringing it\nforward, to which Lord Aberdeen added: \"You mean unless you sit in the\nchair which I now occupy?\" Lord John laughed.\nWe discussed the probable consequences of Lord John's retirement. Lord\nAberdeen thought that Lord Palmerston, Lord Lansdowne, and even Lord\nClarendon would secede with him, but this by no means implied that the\nwhole party would; Lord Palmerston would not coalesce with Lord John,\nbut try for the lead himself; Lord Clarendon quite agreed with Lord\nAberdeen, and had been very angry with Lord John, but was personally\nunder great obligations to him, and Sir James Graham had (as he said)\nbeen very much struck with the change of tone in Lord Clarendon at\nthe last meeting of the Cabinet. Most of the Liberals seemed very much\npleased with their situation. Sir James Graham had, of his own accord,\ntold Lord Aberdeen that, in the event of Lord John's secession, he\nhimself could not well sit in the House of Commons under so much\nyounger a man as Mr Gladstone as Leader. He knew that there would be\nobjections to his assuming the lead himself, but he would be quite\nready to go to the House of Lords to support Lord Aberdeen.\nALBERT.\n+++++++++++++",

They exhibit clearly on his part a _desire_ for war,\nand to drag us into it. When he speaks of the sword which will not\nonly have to be drawn, but the scabbard thrown away, and says, the war\nto be successful must be a \"_very comprehensive one_\" on the part of\nEngland and France, the intention is unmistakable, and it becomes a\nserious question whether we are justified in allowing Lord Stratford\nany longer to remain in a situation which gives him the means of\nfrustrating all our efforts for peace. The question becomes still\ngraver when it is considered that General Baraguay d'Hilliers seems\nfrom Lord Cowley's account of his conversation with him equally\nanxious for extreme measures.\nThe Queen must express her surprise that Lord Stratford should have\ncoolly sent on so preposterous a proposal as Redschid Pasha's note\nasking for a Treaty of Alliance, the amalgamation of our Fleets with\nthe Turkish one, and the sending of our surplus ships to the \"_White_\"\nSea (!) without any hesitation or remark on his part. As the note\nends, however, by saying that the Porte desires _que les points\nci-dessus \u00e9men\u00e9s (sic) soient appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s par les Cours d'Angleterre\net de France, et que ces Cours veuillent bien d\u00e9clarer leur intention\nd'agir en cons\u00e9quence_, this appears to the Queen to afford an\nadmirable opportunity for stating plainly and strongly to the Turkish\nGovernment that we have _no intention_ of being used by them for their\nown purposes. This time such a declaration might be _handed in_ to the\nTurkish Government, so that there can be no mistake about the matter\nfor the future.\nThe Queen encloses the letter and note, and wishes Lord Aberdeen to\nshow her letter to Lord Clarendon.",

    "body": "MY DEAR LORD ABERDEEN,--The Queen has consulted with Lord John\nRussell upon the Reform plan, and on the question of Lord Palmerston's\nposition with regard to it; and he will doubtless give you an account\nof what passed. She wishes me, however, to tell you likewise what\nstrikes her with respect to Lord Palmerston. It appears to the Queen\nclear that the Reform Bill will have no chance of success unless\nprepared and introduced in Parliament by a _united_ Cabinet; that,\nif Lord Palmerston has made up his mind to oppose it and to leave the\nGovernment, there will be no use in trying to keep him in it, and that\nthere will be danger in allowing him to attend the discussions of\nthe Cabinet, preparing all the time his line of attack; that if a\nsuccessor to him would after all have to be found at the Home Office,\nit will be unfair not to give that important member of the Government\nfull opportunity to take his share in the preparation and deliberation\non the measure to which his consent would be asked. Under these\ncircumstances it becomes of the highest importance to ascertain--\n1. What the amount of objection is that Lord Palmerston entertains to\nthe Measure;\n2. What the object of the declaration was, which he seems to have made\nto you.\nThis should be obtained _in writing_, so as to make all future\nmisrepresentation impossible, and on this alone a decision can well\nbe taken, and, in the Queen's opinion, even the Cabinet could alone\ndeliberate.\nShould Lord Palmerston have stated his objections with the view of\nhaving the Measure modified it will be right to consider how far that\ncan safely be done, and for the Queen, also, to balance the probable\nvalue of the modification with the risk of allowing Lord Palmerston to\nput himself at the head of the Opposition Party, entailing as it does\nthe possibility of his forcing himself back upon her as leader of that\nParty.\nShould he on the other hand consider his declaration as a \"notice\nto quit,\" the ground upon which he does so should be clearly put on\nrecord, and no attempt should be made to damage the character of the\nMeasure in the vain hope of propitiating him. Ever yours truly,\nALBERT.",

Lord Palmerston has sent in his resignation in a\nshort note to Lord Aberdeen, a further correspondence with Lord John\nand Lord Lansdowne, Lord Aberdeen put into my hands, and I have copied\nthe two most important letters which follow here.\nLord John is reported as very angry, calling Lord Palmerston's conduct\n\"treacherous,\" a term Lord Aberdeen hardly understands, as against him\nhe has been perfectly consistent with regard to the Reform Measure,\nfrom the beginning, and had frequently denied the necessity of\nReform.... Lord Aberdeen had advised Lord John to show boldness and\nenergy, and to undertake the Home Office at once himself; this would\nhave a great effect under the difficulties of the circumstances,\nwould show that he was in earnest and determined to carry his Reform\nMeasure. Lord John seemed hit by the idea, but asked for time to\nconsider; after seeing _Lady_ John, however, he declined.\nLord Aberdeen's fears are still mainly as to the Eastern Question,\nLord John pressing for war measures. Lord Aberdeen had followed my\nadvice, and had a long explanation on the subject, in which they\nboth agreed that their policy should be one of Peace, and he thought\nmatters settled when Lord John now asks for contingent engagements to\nmake war on Russia if her forces cross the Danube (which Lord Aberdeen\nthinks quite uncalled for), and to convoy the Turkish expeditions in\nthe Black Sea, even if directed against Russian territory, etc., etc.\nThe Cabinet is certain not to agree to either of these propositions.\nWhen Lord Aberdeen announced the intended rupture with Lord Palmerston\nto Lord John, he drily said: \"Well, it would be very awkward for you\nif Palmerston quarrels one day with you about Reform, and I the next\nabout Turkey!\"\nThere can be no doubt that Lord Palmerston will at once try to put\nhimself at the head of the late Protectionist party, and, with the\npresent indifference of the Country upon Reform, the fate of the Bill\nis by no means certain. On the question of Peace or War, Lord\nAberdeen is quite certain that the House of Commons will adopt no war\nresolutions.\nMuch will depend, however, on the line taken by Lord Lansdowne, who\nhas great influence in the House of Lords, and whose secession would\nspread great alarm over the Country as to the real tendency of the\nMeasure (which the Duke of Newcastle describes as in fact a great\nincrease of power to the land). We agree that the Queen should\nwrite to him to prevent any hasty step.\nThe Queen sanctioned the offer of the Home Office to Sir George Grey,\nand of a seat in the Cabinet to Mr Cardwell (the President of the\nBoard of Trade).\nALBERT.",

As the Queen understands it, it promises war with Russia\nin a given contingency, but the contingency is: Russia rejecting terms\nwhich are \"in their spirit and character such as Your Excellency sets\nforth in your Despatch.\" The Queen finds it impossible to make such\ntremendous consequences dependent upon such vague expressions. The\nmore so, as \"the spirit and character\" alluded to, appears to her to\nbe, as if purposely, obscure.\nWhen Lord Stratford says, that the Turks would be satisfied \"with a\nrenewal in clear and comprehensive terms of the formal Declarations\nand Treaties already existing in favour of the Porte\"--the Queen\ncannot understand what is meant--as all the former Treaties between\nRussia and Turkey have certainly not been in favour of the Porte.\nNor is it clear to the Queen whether \"the clear and unquestionable\ndeliverance from Russian interference applied to spiritual matters\" is\ncompatible with the former treaties.\nWhilst the Queen, therefore, perfectly agrees in the principle\nthat, should Russia \"for its own unjustifiable objects, show herself\nregardless of the best interests of Europe\" by rejecting every fair\nterm, the time will have arrived \"for adopting measures of more active\ncoercion against her\"--she cannot sanction such a Declaration\nexcept on terms which are so clear in themselves as to exclude all\nmisinterpretation.",

It would, in\nthe Queen's opinion, be necessary, however, distinctly and fully to\nacquaint the Russian Government with the step now agreed upon.\nLord Palmerston's mode of proceeding always had that advantage, that\nit threatened steps which it was hoped would not become necessary,\nwhilst those hitherto taken, started on the principle of not\nneedlessly offending Russia by threats, obliging us at the same time\nto take the very steps which we refused to threaten.\nThe Queen has to make one more and a most _serious_ observation.

Lord John's expression\nwas: \"Yes, it would ruin anybody but Palmerston.\"\nLord Aberdeen thinks, however, that he can make no further\ndifficulties about Reform, and he, Lord John, and Graham were\ndetermined to make no material alterations in the Bill. Graham is\nsuspicious lest the wish to get Palmerston in again, on the part of\na section of the Cabinet, was an intrigue to get the Measure\nemasculated.

    "body": "DEAR SIR AND BROTHER,--General Count von der Gr\u00f6ben has brought me the\nofficial letter of your Majesty, as well as the confidential one,\nand I send your kind messenger back, with these two answers to you. He\nwill be able to tell you, orally, what I can express only imperfectly\nin writing, how deep my pain is, after our going so far, faithfully,\nhand in hand, to see you, at this weighty moment, separating yourself\nfrom us. My pain is still further increased by the fact that I cannot\neven conceive the grounds which move your Majesty to take this step.\nThe most recent Russian proposals came as an answer to the _last_\nattempt for an understanding which the Powers believed could be\narrived at honourably, and they have been rejected by the Vienna\nConference, not because they were not in accordance with the literal\nwording of the programme, but because they were contrary to the\nintention of it. Your Majesty's Ambassador has taken part in this\nConference and its decision, and when your Majesty now says: \"The task\nof Diplomacy ceases at the exact point where that of the Sovereigns\nemphatically begins\"; I am unable to assent to such a definition. For\nwhat my Ambassador does, he does in my name, and I feel myself not\nonly bound in honour thereby, but also placed under an obligation\nto take upon myself the _consequences_ which the step which he is\ndirected to take may lead to.\nThe dreadful and incalculable consequences of a War weigh upon my\nheart not less than on your Majesty's. I also know that the Emperor of\nRussia does not wish for it. He, none the less, demands from the Porte\nthings which all the Powers of Europe--among them, yourself--have\nsolemnly declared to be incompatible with the independence of the\nPorte, and the European balance of power. In view of this declaration\nand of the presence of the Russian Army of invasion in the\nPrincipalities, the Powers could not but be ready to confirm their\nword by action. If \"the Turk\" now goes into the background, and if\nthe approaching War appears to you as a \"War of tendency\" this is\nthe case only because the very motives which may induce the Emperor to\ninsist on his demands--in defiance of the opposition of the whole of\nEurope, and with the danger of a War that may devastate the world, do\nbetray a _distinct tendency_, and because the grave consequences of\nthe War must appear much more momentous than the original ostensible\ncause of it, which at first appeared only as the request for a key to\nthe back door of a mosque.\nYour Majesty asks me \"to examine the question in a spirit of love for\npeace, and even now to build a bridge for the Imperial honour.\" Ah, my\ndear Sir and Brother, all the inventive gifts, all the architecture\nof diplomacy and of goodwill, have been uselessly wasted during these\nlast nine months in this bridge-building! The _Projets de Notes, de\nConventions, de Protocoles_, etc., etc., have proceeded, by the dozen,\nfrom the Chancelleries of the different Powers, and one might call\nthe ink wasted on them another Black Sea. But everything has been\nshipwrecked against the self-will of your honourable brother-in-law.\nIf now your Majesty informs me \"_that now you mean to persist in\ncomplete neutrality_,\" and if, on this occasion, you refer us to your\nNation, who are said to exclaim with sound common sense: \"Acts of\nviolence have been done by the Turks, the Turk has good friends\nin large numbers, and the Emperor has done us no harm\"--I do not\nunderstand you. Certainly I should understand this language if I\nheard it from the Kings of Hanover or of Saxony. But I have, hitherto,\nlooked upon Prussia as one of the Great Powers which, since the peace\nof 1815, have been guarantors of treaties, guardians of civilisation,\ndefenders of the right, the real arbiters of the Nations; and for\nmy part I have felt the divine responsibility of this sacred office,\nwithout undervaluing at the same time the heavy obligation, not\nunconnected with danger, which it imposes on me. If you, dear Sir\nand Brother, abdicate these obligations, you have also abdicated that\nposition for Prussia. And should such an example find imitators, then\nthe civilisation of Europe would be delivered up to the play of winds;\nright will then no longer find a champion, the oppressed will find no\nlonger an umpire.\nLet not your Majesty believe that what has been said in this letter\nis aimed at persuading you to change your resolves; it flows from the\naffectionate heart of a sister, who could not pardon herself, were she\nnot, at so weighty a moment, to let you see into her inmost soul. So\nlittle is it my intention to desire to win you over to our view, that\nnothing has grieved me more than the suspicion, expressed in your name\nby General von der Gr\u00f6ben, that England had desired to seduce you from\nyour purpose by opening a prospect of advantages to be gained. The\nbaselessness of such a supposition is evident from the Treaty itself\nwhich had been offered to you, and whose most important clause\nconsisted in the promise of the contracting parties, _not to desire in\nany case to derive from the War any advantage for themselves_.\nYour Majesty could not have given a more powerful proof of your\nunselfishness than by the very fact of attaching your signature to\nthis Treaty.\nTo come to a close. You suppose that War may already have been\ndeclared; you express, however, at the same time, the hope that it may\nnot already have actually broken out. I cannot unfortunately hold out\nany hope that the sentence will be followed by any stay of execution.\nShakespeare's words:\n\"Beware\n  Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,\n  Bear it that the opposer may beware of thee,\"\nare deeply engraved on the hearts of all Englishmen. Sad that they\nare to find an application at this crisis, in a nation with whom\npreviously nothing prevailed but friendship and affection! And how\nmuch more melancholy must be the present emotions of your Majesty's\nheart and mind to see such words applied to a beloved brother-in-law,\nwhom yet--however much you love him--your conscience cannot absolve\nfrom the crime of having brought upon the world wilfully and\nfrivolously such awful misery!\nMay the Almighty take you under His protection!\nWith Albert's most cordial compliments, and our united greetings\nto the dear Queen, I remain, my much honoured Sir and Brother, your\nMajesty's faithful Sister and Friend,\nVICTORIA R.",

He reported that at that interview Lord John renewed his\ncomplaint of the Cabinet, declared that he could not state to the\nHouse what was untrue, and must therefore resign. Lord Aberdeen called\nthis \"really too monstrous\" after the pledge given by the Sovereign,\nhimself as Prime Minister, and the whole Cabinet, with the exception\nof one man, and he would repeat his promise that whenever Lord John\nsaid, \"The Reform Bill is to come on,\" and Lord Palmerston opposed it,\nhe should go.\nLord John could not be appeased, but spoke with the greatest\nbitterness. He had written to Lord Palmerston in the same sense; and\nLord Palmerston's answer arrived during the interview. It was to the\neffect that if one of them was to resign, it was not Lord John, who\nagreed with the rest of the Cabinet upon the Bill, but himself,\nwho was the dissentient. Lord Aberdeen asked Lord John whether Lord\nPalmerston's resignation would satisfy him; to which he answered, he\nbelieved it would not mend matters. Lord Aberdeen's opinion, however,\nis that it is what Lord John, and still more what Lady John, wants.\nHe thinks the Country will never understand how the Government could\nbreak up, and that Lord John is cutting his own throat, and told him\nso. If Lord John went, he could not go on with Lord Palmerston as\nLeader of the House of Commons, which he called \"perfectly ludicrous.\"\nLord Palmerston would probably insist upon this, however; Lord\nPalmerston's retirement would be a great blow to the Government, as\nthe Country persisted in thinking him the only able War Minister, and\nwould cry out at \"the imbecile old Head of the Government having it\nnow all his own way.\" He thought, should he not be able to go on, new\ncombinations could be formed, perhaps under the Duke of Newcastle and\nMr Gladstone, as the Country liked younger men. Lord John must give\nhis answer in the House of Commons to-morrow at half-past four. Lord\nAberdeen would wish to see the Duke of Newcastle, Sir James Graham,\nand Mr Gladstone, as his more particular friends, this evening, to\ndiscuss the whole question with them, and would see Lord Palmerston\nand Lord John to-morrow, before he could make any report to the Queen.\nThis is all really very bad!\nALBERT.",

    "body": "MY DEAR COUSIN,--Before leaving this place I think it right that I\nshould once more trouble you with a letter, to inform you that the\nmessenger has arrived who brought your autograph letter for the\nEmperor, which I presented to him to-day at an audience I had for this\npurpose.... I had a very long and most interesting conversation with\nthe Emperor, who opened frankly and fairly upon the great questions\nof the day. The impression he made upon me was an excellent one, his\nconfidence and frankness are complete, and I have the firm conviction\nthat he is a man of his word, and that he never would say a thing\nthat he did not in his heart mean. The result of what he said was\nthe following: that he naturally was most distressed at all that\nhad occurred; that he was placed by the Emperor of Russia in a most\ndifficult position; that he quite disapproved his acts; but that he\ncould not but have a great disinclination to break with a very old\nally; and that even still he hoped this painful step might be spared\nto him by the Emperor of Russia making some proposal so honourable to\nall parties, that it would not be rejected by the Western Powers,\nwho would naturally not be disinclined to a peace, honourable to\nthemselves and tranquillising for the future; that the basis of such\ntreaty would be the position of the Christian population of the\nEast; that this might be discussed in Conference, the Russians having\n_first_ evacuated the Principalities, upon which the Turks would\nhold the right bank of the Danube, our Fleets to await events in\nthe Bosphorus, and our armies at Constantinople, such position being\nhighly honourable and advantageous to us in the eyes of Europe, and\ncertainly not nearly so favourable to Russia; that he was certainly\nsensible that the English Government had not pressed him, feeling\nas they had done the extreme delicacy of his position, and the great\nextent of his frontier so easily attacked; that he did not wish to say\nnow, till the moment of decision came, thinking it more honourable\nand straightforward not to raise false expectations, but that his\ninterests being so completely with us, should the Emperor of Russia\ndo nothing in the honourable direction he hoped to see him adopt, he\nshould then consider himself called upon to express frankly to us what\nhe proposed to do, in order that our action might become united and\nof advantage to one another. He further thought that the treaty with\nPrussia would greatly facilitate all this, as Prussia had acceded to\nthe wishes of Austria in the event of certain eventualities, which,\nhowever, for the moment are not named, but which, as far as I\nunderstand, go to the length of leaving Austria unfettered to act as\nshe likes at the moment when she considers her so doing essential to\nher position as a young Empire. It is quite evident to me that this is\nthe general feeling here, amongst all those who have any weight in the\ncouncils of the Empire. These are _Austrian_ views, and I must say I\ncan understand them and appreciate them as such. I am confident, I am\ncertain, they are _honest_ on the part of the Emperor, and I doubt\nnot he will carry them through to the letter, for I am confident\nthe Emperor never would say what he did not mean. Rely upon it, this\nCountry will never go with Russia; she knows her interests too well\nfor that; she would like to avoid a War altogether if she could,\nand with that view she would be delighted to see some honourable and\nacceptable proposal made, but should this fail she will then take a\nvery decided line, and that line will be in accordance with Austrian\ninterests--which means with us. I find that most of the more prudent\npeople, and many of those in high office, are fully alive to the\nadvantages of the English alliance, and would wish to see this\nalliance confirmed _de novo_; and I think it would be very well for us\nto meet them half-way with this. But then it would be better to avoid\nall after-dinner speeches such as those at the Reform Club, all\nPolish legions such as are talked of, and in short any of these little\nmatters, which are painfully felt here, and which always produce an\nuncomfortable and distrustful effect. The Emperor expressed himself in\nthe most grateful manner towards yourself, and I think is pleased at\nyour having permitted me to be present on this occasion.... Hoping\nthat you will approve of my humble endeavours here, and with sincere\nregards to Albert, I beg to remain, my dear Cousin, your most dutiful\nCousin,\nGEORGE.",

    "body": "MY DEAR COUSIN,--I have not as yet announced to you my safe arrival\nhere, as I was anxious first to see the Sultan and the general state\nof things before giving you a report of what was really going on....\nI found a great proportion of the Infantry arrived, a portion of the\nArtillery, but as yet no Cavalry. Lord Raglan is well and in good\nspirits, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe ill in bed with a bad fit of the\ngout--most miserable to see in every respect. The Sultan received\nme at once on the day of arrival, and made his return visit to\nme yesterday. I confess I was not much impressed with either his\nappearance or general ability. He is, to say the truth, a wretched\ncreature, prematurely aged, and having nothing whatever to say for\nhimself. A few commonplace civilities was all the conversation which\npassed between us. I said everything I could think of to make a\nconversation, among other things messages of civility from yourself;\nbut though he appeared pleased and expressed his satisfaction at our\nbeing here, I could not get him to enter into anything, and I was not\nsorry on both occasions when our interview was at an end. As to his\nMinisters, and in fact the whole population and country, with the\nexception of Redschid Pasha, they are all a most wretched and\nmiserable set of people, and far, far worse than anything I could\npossibly have imagined or supposed. In fact, the \"sick man\" is\n_excessively sick indeed_, dying as fast as possible; and the sooner\ndiplomacy disposes of him the better, for no earthly power can save\nhim, that is very evident. This is the opinion of every person out\nhere of both armies, French and English, and you may rest assured it\nis the truth. The great thing is that we are here and no other Power\ncan now step in, but diplomacy must settle what is to happen, for as\nto the Turks remaining in Europe that is out of the question, and the\nvery fact of our being here now has given them their death-blow. I\nhope, my dear cousin, you will forgive me for being very candid on\nthis point, but I really do not think that anybody in England had any\nidea of the real state of affairs here. The sooner therefore that they\nare put in possession of the truth unvarnished the better. The great\nand imperative necessity is that the four Powers of Europe should\nstrike together, otherwise things will become much worse than they\nare even at present. Everybody is very civil and obliging to me, the\nSultan has put me into one of his best Palaces, very nicely fitted up,\nand is anxious to do everything I wish. I find it inconvenient, as the\ntroops are on the other side of the Bosphorus, and I therefore intend\ngoing over there to reside if possible. Marshal St Arnaud is here and\nPrince Napoleon, but no French troops. I have seen the latter once; he\nwas very civil indeed to me, but I do not think he has made at all a\ngood impression here, his manner being offensive and harsh. I do not\nthink the Army like him at all. I am afraid the French Ambassador is\ngiving much trouble. Neither St Arnaud nor the Prince like him at all,\nand I believe they have written to demand his recall, which would be\na very good thing, as he cannot hit it off with anybody. As to our\nmovements, I know nothing of them as yet, nor do I think that much has\nas yet been settled, but I fear we shall not be fit to move for some\ntime; the difficulty of transport is very great, our Artillery\nonly partly arrived, and no Cavalry. We require more troops, more\nparticularly of the latter arm, in which the Russians are very strong.\nWe ought to have at least 10,000 men more, and the sooner they are\nsent out the better. Even that number is not enough, for the French\ntalk of 100,000 men, and we should be in a most dreadful minority\nunless we had 40,000 to 50,000. I am afraid all this will alarm people\nin England, but it is the truth.... I remain, my dear Cousin, your\nmost dutiful Cousin,\nGEORGE.\nWe never hear any news here. All that does come to us generally comes\nby way of Europe; another proof of what a miserable country this is.",

    "body": "MOST GRACIOUS QUEEN,--... My policy, which has been so terribly\ncriticised and derided as \"vacillating,\" has been, since the beginning\nof this most inauspicious conflict, one and the same, and _without a\nhairsbreadth of deviation_ either to the right or to the left. As it\nrests on the unshakable foundation which my conscience as a King and\na Christian has laid down, and which does not admit _que je fasse la\nbesogne ni de l'un ni de l'autre parti_, I am abused and insulted\nat the Winter Palace, and regarded, by way of contrast in London and\nParis, as a kind of simpleton--neither of which is pleasant.\nMay your Majesty believe my Royal Word: I was, I am, I remain the\ntruest and most faithful friend of Great Britain, as well in principle\nas from religious feeling and from true affection. I desire and\npractise a good and honest understanding with France; but when it\ncomes to helping the French--to whom Prussia's geographical position\nbetween Paris and Warsaw is very inconvenient--to pull the _chestnuts\nfrom the fire_ for them, for such a task I am frankly too good. If the\nEmperor wishes to force me to assist--as evidently he is inclined to\ndo--it will end by becoming too difficult for him. He ought to thank\nGod that my view of Russian policy and my fidelity to your Majesty\nhave prevented me from making him begin this _Turkish_ War on the\n_other side of his own frontier_. The great advantage of this result\nis totally forgotten in France, and, unfortunately, in England too.\nThose who every day fill the papers of home and foreign countries with\naccounts of my vacillations, nay, who represent me as leaping from my\nown horse on to a Russian one, are inventing lies, in a great measure,\ndeliberately. I tell your Majesty, on my honour and conscience, that\nmy policy is to-day _the same_ as it was nine months ago. I have\nrecognised it as my duty before God to preserve, for my people and my\nprovinces, peace, _because I recognise Peace as a blessing and War\nas a curse_. I cannot and will not side with Russia, because Russia's\narrogance and wickedness have caused this _horrible_ trouble, and\nbecause duty and conscience and tradition forbid me to draw the sword\nagainst Old England. In the same degree duty and conscience forbid\nme to make unprovoked war against Russia, because Russia, so far,\nhas done me no harm. So I thought, so I willed when I thought myself\nisolated. How then could I now suddenly abandon a steady policy,\npreserved in the face of many dangers, and incline to Russia at the\nmoment when I have concluded with Austria an Alliance defensive and\noffensive, in which (if God grant His blessing) the whole of Germany\nwill join in a few days, thus welding, for the entire duration of the\nWar, the whole of Central Europe into a Unity, comprising 72,000,000\npeople, and easily able to put 1,000,000 men into the field? And\nyet, most gracious Queen, I do not take up a defiant position on the\nstrength of this enormous power, but I trust in the Lord's help and\nmy own sacred Right; I also believe, honestly and firmly, that the\ncharacter of a so-called Great Power must justify itself, _not by\nswimming with the current_, but _by standing firm like a rock in the\nsea_.\nI close this letter which, in consequence of various interruptions,\nis almost a week old, on the 24th of May. This is your birthday, ever\ndearest, most gracious Queen. On this day I lay at your Majesty's feet\nthe expression of my wishes for every blessing. May God grant your\nMajesty a joyful day, and a richly blessed year of rule. May He\nstrengthen, preserve, and invigorate your precious health, and may He\ngive you, within the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year\nof your life which begins to-day, _that_ one day of overabundant\nblessing, of unspeakable joy, for which I long, for which I pray to\nGod--_that blissful day on which you can utter the word_ PEACE.\nNow I beg your Majesty from the bottom of my heart not to be angry\nwith me for my unconscionably long letter, nor to worry yourself\nabout sending an answer, but, on the other hand, graciously to keep\nit secret, communicating it only to the dear Prince. It is a matter\nof course that the facts which it contains, and the resulting\nexplanations, which may be of importance for your Majesty's\nGovernment, must, from their nature, no longer be kept secret, so\nsoon as you think it right to announce them. I embrace the dear Prince\ntenderly, and commend myself to the grace, goodwill, and friendship\nof my august Royal Sister, I being your Majesty's most faithfully\ndevoted, most attached Servant and Good Brother,\nFREDERIC WILLIAM.",

Sympathy with his fate is general here. I entirely recognise in\nyour letter the expression of your friendship, which is so dear to me,\nand which does not admit any sort of misunderstanding to exist between\nus, without my endeavouring at once to clear it up and remove it.\nHow could I meet your friendship otherwise than by equally absolute\nfrankness, allowing you to look into my inmost heart! Though you have\nshown me a proof of your gracious confidence in giving me, down to the\nsmallest detail, an account of your personal and business relations\nwith your servants, I still believe that I have no right to formulate\nany judgment. Only one thing my heart bids me to express, viz., that\nthe men with whom you have broken were faithful, veracious servants,\nwarmly devoted to you, and that just by the freedom and independence\nof spirit, with which they have expressed their opinions to your\nMajesty, _they have given an indisputable proof_ of having had\nin view, not their own personal advantage and the favour of their\nSovereign, but his true interests and welfare alone; and if just such\nmen as these--among them even your loving brother, a thoroughly noble\nand chivalrous Prince, standing next to the throne--find themselves\nforced, in a grave crisis, to turn away from you, this is a _momentous\nsign_, which might well give cause to your Majesty to take counsel\nwith yourself, and to examine with anxious care, whether perhaps the\nhidden cause of past and future evils may not lie in your Majesty's\nown views? You complain, most honoured Sire and Brother, that\nyour policy is blamed as _vacillating_, and that your own person is\ninsulted at home and abroad (a thing which has often filled me with\n_deep grief and indignation_), and you asseverate that your policy\nrests upon a firm basis, which the conscience of \"a King and a\nChristian has laid down for it.\" But should it be possible to discover\nin your Majesty's fundamental views something self-contradictory,\nthen necessarily, the more consistently and conscientiously these\nfundamental views are revealed in their consequences, the more\ncontradictory must your actions appear to those who are not intimately\naware of your intentions, and cannot but force upon the world the\nimpression that your views themselves were wavering.\nYou will not take it amiss in a true friend and sister, if she\nendeavours to place before you her impressions on this matter, as\nfrankly as they appear to her.\nYour Majesty has acknowledged in the face of the world that Russia\nhas addressed to the Porte demands which she had no right to make. You\nhave further acknowledged that the forcible taking possession of two\nTurkish provinces with the intention of enforcing the demand was a\npolitical wrong. You have, together with Austria, France, and England,\nseveral times declared in Protocols the preservation of the integrity\nof the Turkish empire to be a European interest. Notwithstanding all\nthis, Russia continues to occupy the Danube principalities, penetrates\nfurther into Turkey, and, by forcing on a sanguinary and exhausting\nwar, leads the unhappy and _suffering_ empire on to the brink of the\ngrave. What should Europe then do under these circumstances?\nIt could not possibly be the intention of the Powers to declare the\npreservation and integrity of the Porte to be a matter of European\nconcern, solely in order to allow that empire to be destroyed before\ntheir very eyes! As to Prussia, I can conceive a line of policy, not\nthat indeed which I should think in harmony with the generosity and\nchivalry of your rule, but still one possible in itself, by which\nshe would say to herself: \"The preservation of this integrity I have\nindeed declared to be a matter of European concern, but I wish to\nleave England and France to defend that policy with their wealth and\nblood, and reserve to myself only a _moral_ co-operation.\" But what am\nI to think if, after England and France with courageous readiness have\ntaken upon themselves alone this immense responsibility, sacrifice,\nand danger, your Majesty is now mainly considering the erection of\na barrier of 72,000,000 of men between them and that Power, against\nwhose encroachment the European interest is to be defended? What am I\nto say to the threat uttered against the _West_ as well as against\nthe _East?_ and to your even asking from the West gratitude for \"the\nenormous advantage\" that you do not, into the bargain, yourself join\nin attacking it!! For your Majesty says expressly in your letter:\n\"The Emperor ought to thank God that my view of Russian policy, my\n_fidelity_ to your Majesty, have prevented me from making him begin\nthe Turkish war on the other side of his own frontier. The enormous\nadvantage of this abstention is totally forgotten in France, and,\nunfortunately, in England too!\"\nDearest Sir and Brother, this language shows a contradiction in\nyour own mind, which fills me with the greatest anxiety for possible\nconsequences, an anxiety not diminished by your kindly adding: \"Duty,\nConscience, and Tradition forbid you to draw the sword against Old\nEngland.\"\nI shall gladly with you bless the day on which the word of Peace can\nbe uttered. Your Majesty can, by vigorous co-operation, help to usher\nin that day, just as you might have--in my conviction--contributed, by\nvigorous co-operation to prevent the War altogether.\nWhatever these troublous times may bring us, I harbour the firm\nconfidence that the warmth of our friendly relations cannot be\ntroubled by anything, and rejoice in the circumstance that the\npersonal relations of the two Sovereigns are, in this matter, so\nentirely in harmony with the interests of the two nations.\nAlbert sends you his homage, and I remain, with most cordial\nremembrance to the dear Queen, and with thanks for the kind wishes\nexpressed by both of you, ever your Majesty's faithful Sister and\nFriend,\nVICTORIA R.",

The account sent by Lord Stratford of\nthe victory on the Alma must be correct; the report mentioned by Mr\nColquhoun may possibly be so too. At all events, we may fairly\nhope that the fall of Sebastopol cannot long be delayed.\nLord Aberdeen has written to Lord Clarendon this morning on the\nsubject of the fortifications of Sebastopol, which although, somewhat\nembarrassing at the moment, is not attended with any great practical\nimportance.\nLord Aberdeen regrets that the speedy return of the post prevents him\nfrom sending your Majesty a copy of his letter, which in substance,\nhowever, was to the following effect. Without attaching any undue\nimportance to the decision, he was inclined to adhere to his first\nproposition of the immediate and entire destruction of the works.\nHe did not see the advantage of doing the thing by halves; while the\ndestruction of the sea defences only might give rise to erroneous\nimpressions and would be of an equivocal character. The fall of\nSebastopol would in fact be the conquest of the Crimea, and the Allies\nmight winter there with perfect security, as, by occupying the\nlines of Perekop, any access to the Crimea would effectually be\nprevented by land. Lord Aberdeen thought that with a view to peace,\nand the restitution of the Crimea to Russia, it would be more easy\nfor the Emperor to accept the destruction of the fortifications when\naccomplished, than to agree to any stipulation having such an object.\nOn the whole, Lord Aberdeen was inclined to think that if the place\nshould not be at once destroyed, it might be better to preserve it in\nits present state, until the matter should be further considered.\nThe Allies would always have it in their power to act as they thought\nbest, and the question might in some degree be affected by future\nevents.

Many things unite to warn him that it is time he were\ngone: and his family circumstances, in which your Majesty has long\nshown so gracious an interest, have rendered the prospect of his\nremaining longer absent from England a source of much anxiety and\nperplexity to him. But he felt that this was no time for any man, high\nor low, to leave his post. And as a seven-years' experience must needs\nhave rendered him more capable of immediate usefulness than any other,\nthough a far abler man, without such experience could possibly be,\nhe did not hesitate to offer the continued service which your Majesty\nmight most justly expect, and which he is proud to render cheerfully.\nYour Majesty's remark on the absence of any letter from the\nGovernor-General of late would have disquieted him with apprehensions\nthat he had been thought neglectful, but that your Majesty at the same\ntime ascribed the silence to its real cause. Since the announcement\nof the termination of the Burmese War there has, in truth, been no\noccurrence which, of itself, seemed worthy of being made the subject\nof a report to your Majesty. India has been tranquil in all her\nborders. And although no event could well be more gratifying than this\ncontinuous tranquillity was in itself, still the periodical report of\npeace and quiet on all sides seemed likely to be as uninteresting\nas the monotonous, though satisfactory, \"All's well\" of a ring of\nsentries.\nAt Christmas the Governor-General anticipated having the honour of\nnarrating to your Majesty the events of a year which he hoped would,\nbefore its close, have been fruitful of great results....\nVery recently an interesting mission has arrived from the Khan of\nKokan, a state to the north of Bokhara, reporting the capture of their\nfort of Ak Mussid by the Russians.\nThe fact was known before; but the mission is important from the\ncertainty it imparts to us that all the Turcomans, the people of\nKokan, of Khiva, and of Bokhara, all detest as much as they dread the\nMuscovites, with whose approach they are threatened.\nThe Khan asks for aid. We can render him but little. The only real\nbulwark which can be raised for these states of Central Asia--the only\nreal barrier to the progress of Russia which can be set up there--must\nhave their foundations in the Treaty, which may be framed by the\nAllied Powers after the present war shall have brought the spirit of\nRussia into temporary subjection.\nThe war in which your Majesty has engaged with that great Power has\nnot been directly felt in this part of your Majesty's dominions; but\nits indirect influence is most sensibly apparent.\nThe notions entertained of Russia, and the estimate formed of her\npowers, by the nations of India, are exaggerated in the extreme.\nAlthough our pride must wince on hearing it, it is an unquestionable\nfact that the general belief in India at this moment is that Russia\ngravely menaces the power of England, and will be more than a match\nfor her in the end.\nThis feeling cannot prudently be disregarded. The Governor-General\nneed hardly say to your Majesty that he believes that any direct\nattack by Russia on these dominions at the present time is utterly\nimpracticable; and that there is no more risk of an invasion of\nIndia by the Emperor Nicholas than of another by Mahmood of Ghuznee.\nNevertheless, the uneasy feeling which now prevails among native\nStates and among ourselves, partly of alarm, partly of indefinite\nexpectation, ought to be guarded against; and the means of meeting any\ndifficulties which may arise out of it should be at our command.\nEarnestly desirous to contribute every possible aid to your Majesty's\narms in the great contest now going on in Europe, the Governor-General\nhas respectfully placed at the disposal of your Majesty's Ministers\nall the four regiments of Royal Cavalry now serving in India. The\nInfantry is already hardly adequate for our own necessities: and while\nthe Governor-General will be quite ready to accept and to face any\nadditional responsibilities which he may be called upon to bear, he\nhas felt it to be his duty to state that, beyond the four regiments\nof Cavalry, European troops cannot safely be spared from India at the\npresent time.\nThe Governor-General, however, feels that he is not indulging in any\nvain boast when he ventures to assure your Majesty that, under God's\ngood blessing, these, your Dominions in the East, are at present\nabsolutely safe.... Your Majesty's most obedient, most humble, and\ndevoted Subject and Servant,\nDALHOUSIE.",

    "body": "As the Queen knows that the East India Company are chiefly guided by\nLord Dalhousie's advice with respect to all Indian affairs in public\nas well as of a more private nature, she thinks that she cannot do\nbetter than write to him upon a subject which she _feels_ strongly\nupon, and which she is sure that Lord Dalhousie will enter into. It\nis the position of those unfortunate Indian Princes who have, either\nthemselves or their fathers, been for public reasons deposed. Two\ninstances are now before the Queen's eyes upon which she wishes to\nstate her opinion.\nThe first is old Prince Gholam Mohammed, and his son Prince Feroz\nShah. The Queen understands (though she is not sure of the fact) that\nthe old man is here in order to try to obtain his pension continued\nto his son. This is very natural, and it strikes the Queen to be an\narrangement difficult to be justified, in a moral point of view, to\ngive these poor people--who after _all_ were once so mighty--_no_\nsecurity beyond their lives. Whilst we remain permanently in\npossession of their vast Empire, they receive a pension, which is not\n_even_ continued to their descendants. Would it not be much the\nbest to allow them, instead of a pension, to hold, perhaps under the\nGovernment, a property, which would enable them and their descendants\nto live respectably, maintaining a certain rank and position? The\nQueen believes that Lord Dalhousie himself suggested this principle in\nthe case of the Ameers of Scinde.\nNothing is more painful for _any_ one than the thought that their\nchildren and grandchildren have no future, and may become absolutely\nbeggars. How much more _dreadful_ must this be to proud people, who,\nlike Prince Gholam, are the sons and grandsons of great Princes like\nHyder Ali and Tippoo Sahib! Besides it strikes the Queen that the more\nkindly we treat Indian Princes, whom _we_ have _conquered_, and the\nmore consideration we show for their birth and former grandeur, the\nmore we shall attach Indian Princes and Governments to us, and the\nmore ready will they be to come under our rule.\nThe second instance is that of the young Maharajah Dhuleep Singh (and\nthe Queen must here observe that the favourable opinion she expressed\nof him, in her last letter to Lord Dalhousie, has only been confirmed\nand strengthened by closer acquaintance). This young Prince has the\n_strongest_ claims upon our generosity and sympathy; deposed, for _no_\nfault of his, when a little boy of ten years old, he is as innocent\nas any private individual of the misdeeds which compelled us to depose\nhim, and take possession of his territories. He has besides since\nbecome a Christian, whereby he is for ever cut off from his own\npeople. His case therefore appears to the Queen still stronger than\nthe _former_ one, as he was not even a conquered enemy, but merely\npowerless in the hands of the Sikh soldiery.\nThere is something too painful in the idea of a young deposed\nSovereign, once so powerful, receiving a pension, and having _no_\nsecurity that his children and descendants, and these moreover\nChristians, should have any home or position.\nThe Queen hears that Lord Dalhousie himself would wish and advise his\npension to be exchanged for a property on which the Maharajah might\nlive, which he might improve (giving thereby a most valuable example)\nand transmit some day to his descendants, should he have any; she\nhopes therefore that this may be so settled, and that he may, on\nattaining the age of eighteen, have a comfortable and fitting position\nworthy his high rank.\nWhere such a property might be must be of course left to Lord\nDalhousie to decide, but the Queen hopes that Lord Dalhousie will give\nit his serious attention.",

The success in the Crimea ought\nto be followed up by strengthening the alliance of the European\npowers, else it may turn out a sterile victory, and the English blood\nwill have flowed in vain; for supposing even the whole Crimea to fall\ninto our hands, it is not likely that the war will be concluded on\nthat account. How are England and France to bring it to a termination\nsingle-handed? Our Army in the Crimea is the only one we have....\nIt is true that the Austrian proposal promises little performance on\nher part, yet the stipulation by Treaty that she will never let the\nRussians pass the Pruth again is a positive advantage to us; and the\nother, that a defensive and offensive alliance with us is to follow\nthe breaking out of the war by Russia against Austria, although being\nentirely at _our_ expense, yet realises the chief condition which\nwill make Austria hesitate less to bring it to a war with Russia.\nShe always (and not without reason) dreaded to have to fight Russia\nsingle-handed, and the allied armies in the Crimea could not assist\nher. What reason could Austria put forward and justify to Prussia and\nGermany, for going to war at this moment? To obtain the evacuation\nof the Principalities was a tangible one, indeed the same _we_ put\nforward when _we_ declared war; but this is now obtained.\nWe must certainly not allow our policy to be mixed up with the\nmiserable German squabbles, but we must acknowledge that Austria, as a\nmember of the Confederation, is not and cannot be independent of them.\nThe Queen would accordingly advise a temperate consideration of the\nAustrian proposals and an amendment of them in those points which seem\nto require them, and which Lord Clarendon clearly points out in his\nletter, and the avoidance of anything which could weaken the _accord\nEurop\u00e9en_.\nThe Emperor Napoleon's answer to Lord Cowley with reference to this\nvisit to England renders it probable to the Queen that he was not\nanxious to have the general invitation changed into a special one,\n_obliging_ him to come or to refuse. The answer is almost a refusal\nnow, and has not improved our position. The Queen would wish that\nno anxiety should be shown to obtain the visit, now that it is quite\nclear to the Emperor that he will be _le bienvenu_ at any time. His\nreception here ought to be a boon to him and not a boon to us.\nThe Queen fully enters into the feelings of exultation and joy at the\nglorious victory of the Alma, but this is somewhat damped by the sad\nloss we have sustained, and the thought of the many bereaved families\nof all classes who are in mourning for those near and dear to them.",

We have received all the\n_most_ interesting and _gratifying_ details of the _splendid_ and\ndecisive victory of the Alma; alas! it was a bloody one. Our loss\nwas a heavy one--many have fallen and many are wounded, but my noble\nTroops behaved with a _courage_ and _desperation_ which was beautiful\nto behold. The Russians expected their position would hold out three\nweeks; their loss was immense--the whole garrison of Sebastopol\nwas out. Since that, the Army has performed a wonderful march to\nBalaklava, and the bombardment of Sebastopol has begun. Lord Raglan's\nbehaviour was worthy of the old Duke's--such coolness in the midst of\nthe hottest fire. We have had all the details from young Burghersh\n(a remarkably nice young man), one of Lord Raglan's Aides-de-camp whom\nhe sent home with the Despatches, who was in the midst of it all.

The Queen regrets to find a Clause omitted which stood\nin the former French project (rejected by us about three weeks ago),\nstipulating that Austria was to prevent the re-entry of Russia into\nthe Principalities. Although she would of her own accord have to do\nthis, a treaty obligation towards the _belligerents_ to that effect\nwould have made a considerable inroad into her position as a _neutral_\npower, and secured a co-operation in the war--_ad hoc_ at least.\nAustria ought to be told, in the Queen's opinion, that this project\nof treaty contains almost nothing; and that her signing it _at once_\nwould give a moral pledge of her sincerity towards the Western Powers,\nwho have to pay with the lives of their best troops every day that\nAustria hesitates to do what in the end she must find it in her own\ninterest to do.\nAs to M.

I\navail myself of your permission to write to you again, although there\nis not much to say since I last wrote to Prince Albert on the 7th or\n8th of this month. I wrote to him soon after the battle of Inkerman,\nwhen I was still under the excitement of that fearful scene, and I am\nafraid that I made use of expressions that I was afterwards sorry that\nI had done. I believe I made some reflections on our Commanders, which\nare at all times wrong. By this time your Majesty will, of course,\nbe in possession of all the details of that fearful day, on which our\nloss was so very great. I made a mistake in stating the number of\ndead in the Grenadiers; it was much larger than I stated. I think we\nmust have suffered more than any other Corps, for, on the following\nday, when the roll was called, two hundred and twenty-five men\nwere absent; of these one hundred and one were killed, and the rest\nwounded. There cannot be any doubt that we allowed ourselves to be\nsurprised, for the first notice we had of the Russians was receiving\ntheir heavy shot in the camp of the 2nd Division. Nearly all their\ntents were torn by round shot. It is even said that a shell lodged\nin an officer's portmanteau, burst, and, of course, scattered all his\ngoods to the winds. Experience has made us wise, or rather Lord Raglan\nwise, for since that day the French and ourselves have been busy in\nentrenching our right; it is now so strong that no enemy can attack us\nthere with the slightest chance of success; it is only a pity it\nwas not done before. The Turks were chiefly employed making these\nredoubts, which is in fact the only thing they have done except\nburying the dead Russians. Never shall I forget the sight of the dead\nand dying Russians on the field. Some of these poor wretches had to\nlie on the field for at least sixty hours before they were removed to\nthe hospital tents; the majority of course died. I am afraid this is\none of the necessities of war, for we had to remove our own people\nfirst. I went round the hospitals next morning. It was a horrid sight\nto see the bodies of the men who had died during the night stretched\nbefore the tents, and to see the heaps of arms and legs, with the\ntrousers and boots still on, that had been cut off by the surgeons.\nThe Russians were so near that most of the officers had to use their\nswords and revolvers. Many single acts of daring took place; among\nothers, Colonel Percy, of our Regiment, dashed in front of his\nCompany, sword in hand, into a dense body of Russians who were in\na battery. I was not in the thick of it, but was engaged with an\noutlying picquet on the left of the attack. George was in the very\nthick of it, and, not seeing me, kept asking some of our men where I\nwas. They did not know. He tells me that he thought for a long time I\nwas killed, and even fancied that he had seen me lying on the ground;\nit turned out later to have been poor Colonel Dawson's body which\nhe mistook for me.\nOn the 14th we had a terrible storm, such a one as, fortunately for\nmankind, does not happen but very rarely. All our tents of course were\nblown down, and we passed the day very uncomfortably; but at sea it\nwas terrible. At Balaklava alone more than two hundred and sixty souls\nperished, and eleven ships went down. George will have been able\nto give you a perfect account of it, for, for many hours, the\n_Retribution_ was in imminent danger. I went a few days after the\nstorm to see him on board. ... He had a little fever or ague on\nhim, but was otherwise well. He has now gone to Constantinople....\nMay I beg of your Majesty to remember me kindly to Prince Albert and\nthe Duchess of Kent. I have the honour, etc.\nEDWARD OF SAXE-WEIMAR.",

    "body": "Lord Aberdeen arrived yesterday evening, leaving the Cabinet sitting,\nrevising the Speech from the Throne. He had come to no decision.\nSir James Graham and Mr Gladstone had been anxious that he should\naccept Lord John's resignation at once. He himself felt reluctant to\ndo anything which might be considered harsh towards Lord John, and\nmight make him a martyr hereafter. There was no doubt, however, that\nthey could not go on with Lord John. The universal feeling of the\nCabinet seemed to be one of indignation ... at Lord John's conduct.\nNobody had expressed himself stronger about it than Lord Lansdowne to\nLord Clarendon, feeling it, as he said, \"quite a necessity to speak\nout.\" The Chancellor said he owed his political allegiance to Lord\nJohn as well as his office; but as a man of honour he could not go\nwith him. Lord Granville feels the same. Lord Palmerston had written\na long and very able letter to Lord John, proving the impossibility\nof joining the offices of Secretary at War and Secretary of State for\nWar. Lord John had now, however, dropped his proposal altogether,\nand made it quite clear that it was Lord Aberdeen he wished to have\nremoved. He said to Lord Palmerston: \"When the Cabinet was formed,\nI always understood that Lord Aberdeen would soon give me up my old\nplace; it has now lasted more than two years, and he seemed to get\nenamoured with office, and I could not meet the House of Commons in\nthe position I was in last Session.\"\nIn answer to Lord Palmerston's enquiry what he would do, and how he\ncould expose the Country to such fearful risks at such a moment, he\nsaid that he would support the Government out of office. \"You will\nsupport it at the head of a very virulent Opposition,\" was Lord\nPalmerston's reply; \"and when you have succeeded in overthrowing the\nGovernment, which has difficulty enough to hold its ground even with\nyour assistance, what will you say to the Country? Will you say:\n'Here I am. I have triumphed, and have displaced, in the midst of most\nhazardous operations, all the ablest men the Country has produced;\nbut I shall take their place with Mr Vernon Smith, Lord Seymour, Lord\nMinto, and others....'\"\nSir Charles Wood is the only person who says it is all nothing, and he\nknows Lord John, and it is sure to blow over.\nLord Aberdeen said it is come to a point where this is no longer\npossible, as he laid his ground not only on the position that the war\nhad been badly conducted, but that it _would_ be so for the future.\nAt the Cabinet yesterday a significant incident occurred: Lord John\nasked what should become of Reform. Lord Aberdeen's answer was, that\nit had been set aside on account of the war, and that as the war was\nnow raging at its height, it could not be brought on again. Later,\nwhen they came to the passage about Education, Lord John made an\nalteration in the Draft, adding something about strengthening the\ninstitutions of the Country. Lord Palmerston started up and asked:\n\"Does that mean Reform?\" Lord John answered: \"It might or might not.\"\n\"Well, then,\" said Lord Palmerston, with a heat of manner which struck\nthe whole Cabinet, and was hardly justified by the occasion, \"I wish\nit to be understood that I protest against any direct or indirect\nattempt to bring forward the Reform question again!\" Lord John,\nnettled, muttered to himself, but loud enough to be heard by\neverybody: \"Then I shall bring forward the Reform Bill at once.\"\nIt is evident to me that after this a junction between Lord Palmerston\nand Lord John is impossible, and that it must have been Lord\nPalmerston's object to make this clear to the Cabinet. Lord Aberdeen\nhas declared that he is quite willing to yield his post to Lord\nJohn--but that it would not suffice to have got a head--that there\nmust be some Members also, and where are they to be found? He is\ncertain that not one of the present Cabinet could now serve under Lord\nJohn. An attempt to solve the question how the present Government is\nto be maintained, naturally leads everybody to the same conclusion:\nthat Lord Palmerston must be substituted for Lord John as the Leader\nof the House of Commons. Disagreeable as this must be ... to Lord\nAberdeen, and dangerous as the experiment may turn out, we agreed with\nLord Aberdeen that he should make the offer to him with the Queen's\nconsent. An alternative proposed by Lord Clarendon, that Lord\nAberdeen should ask Lord John what he advised him to do under the\ncircumstances, was strongly condemned by me, as depriving Lord\nAberdeen of all the advantage of the initiative with Lord Palmerston.\nLord Aberdeen states his great difficulty to be not only the long\nantecedent and mutual opposition between him and Lord Palmerston, but\nalso the fact that Lord Palmerston loved war for war's sake, and he\npeace for peace' sake.... He consoled himself, however, at last by the\nreflection that Lord Palmerston was not worse than Lord John in\nthat respect, and, on the other hand, gave greater weight to the\nconsideration of what was practicable. It remains open for the present\nwhether Lord John is to act as the organ for the Government during the\nshort Session, and resign afterwards, or to resign now.\nALBERT.",

Lord Aberdeen\ntherefore took an opportunity of referring to the correspondence which\nhad taken place, and the notice which had been given by Lord John.\nWithout any embarrassment, or apparent sense of inconsistency, he at\nonce admitted that he had changed his intention, and attributed it\nchiefly to a conversation yesterday with Lord Panmure, who, although a\ngreat military reformer, had convinced him that the present was not a\nfitting time for his proposed changes.\nLord Aberdeen had not seen any member of the Cabinet this evening\nsince the meeting terminated, and does not know how they may be\naffected by this change. Some, he feels sure, will be disappointed;\nbut, on the whole, he feels disposed to be well satisfied. It is true\nthat there can be no security for a single week; and it is impossible\nto escape from a sense of self-degradation by submitting to such an\nunprecedented state of relations amongst colleagues; but the scandal\nof a rupture would be so great, and the evils which might ensue so\nincalculable, that Lord Aberdeen is sincerely convinced it will be\nmost advantageous for your Majesty's service, and for the public,\nto endeavour, by a conciliatory and prudent course of conduct, to\npreserve tranquillity and union as long as possible.

As hostilities ought not to be interrupted unless the Russians\ngive up Sebastopol and evacuate the Crimea (which would give rest\nand quiet to our poor soldiers), there still remains the hope of our\ngetting the place before preliminaries of peace could be signed; and\nin that case a Peace on the four points would be everything we could\ndesire, and much preferable to the chance of future convulsions of the\nwhole state of Europe.

It has not been in his power\nto lighten the burthen of their duties. Those exacted from them before\nSebastopol are for the preservation of the trenches and batteries; and\nthere are many other calls upon the men, more especially when, as at\npresent, the roads are so bad that wheeled carriages can no longer\nbe used, and that the horse transport is diminished by sickness and\ndeath, and that the Commissariat, having no longer any sufficient\nmeans of conveyance at its command, cannot bring up the daily supplies\nwithout their assistance, thereby adding, however inevitably, to their\nlabour and fatigue.\nLord Raglan begs leave to submit, for your Majesty's information, that\nthe Allied Armies have no intercourse with the country, and can derive\nno resources from it; and consequently all the requirements for\nthe conveyance of stores and provisions, as well as the stores and\nprovisions themselves, must be imported. Such a necessity forms in\nitself a difficulty of vast magnitude, which has been greatly felt by\nhim, and has been productive of the most serious consequences to the\ncomfort and welfare of the Army.\nThe coffee sent from Constantinople has been received and issued\nto the troops green, the Commissariat having no means whatever of\nroasting it. Very recently, however, an able officer of the Navy,\nCaptain Heath of the _Sanspareil_, undertook to have machines made by\nthe engineers on board his ship for roasting coffee; and in this he\nhas succeeded, but they have not yet produced as much as is required\nfor the daily consumption.\nThe Commissary-General applied to the Treasury for roasted coffee\nthree months ago. None has as yet arrived. A very large amount of warm\nclothing has been distributed, and your Majesty's soldiers, habited in\nthe cloaks of various countries, might be taken for the troops of any\nnation as well as those of England.\nHuts have arrived in great abundance, and as much progress is made in\ngetting them up as could be hoped for, considering that there has been\na very heavy fall of snow, and that a thaw has followed it, and the\nextremely limited means of conveyance at command.\nMuch having been said, as Lord Raglan has been given to understand, in\nprivate letters, of the inefficiency of the officers of the Staff, he\nconsiders it to be due to your Majesty, and a simple act of justice to\nthose individuals, to assure your Majesty that he has every reason\nto be satisfied with their exertions, their indefatigable zeal, and\nundeviating, close attention to their duties, and he may be permitted\nto add that the horse and mule transport for the carriage of\nprovisions and stores are under the charge of the Commissariat, not of\nthe Staff, and that the Department in question engages the men who are\nhired to take care of it, and has exclusive authority over them.\nLord Raglan transmitted to the Duke of Newcastle, in the month of\nDecember, the report of a Medical Board, which he caused to assemble\nat Constantinople for the purpose of ascertaining the state of health\nof the Duke of Cambridge. The report evidently showed the necessity of\nHis Royal Highness's return to England for its re-establishment.\nThis, Lord Raglan knows, was the opinion of the Honourable\nLieutenant-Colonel Macdonald, whose attention and devotion to\nHis Royal Highness could not be surpassed, and who was himself very\nanxious to remain with the Army.\nThe Duke, however, has not gone further than Malta, where, it is said,\nhis health has not improved.",

The Duke then made his proposal, and was followed by Lord\nPalmerston, who stated pretty much the same as he had done in the\nmorning, upon which Sir George Grey said it did both the Duke and Lord\nPalmerston the highest honour, but he saw no possibility of resisting\nMr Roebuck's Motion without Lord John; Sir Charles Wood was of the\nsame opinion. Lord Clarendon proposed that, as the Duke had given\nup his Department to Lord Palmerston, Lord John might be induced to\nremain; but this was at once rejected by Lord Aberdeen on the ground\nthat they might be justified in sacrificing the Duke to the wishes\nof the Country, but they could not to Lord John, with any degree of\nhonour. The upshot was, that the Whig Members of the Cabinet, not\nbeing inclined to carry on the Government (including Lord Lansdowne),\nthey came to the unanimous determination to tender their resignations.\nThe Queen protested against this, as exposing her and the Country to\nthe greatest peril, as it was impossible to change the Government at\nthis moment without deranging the whole external policy in diplomacy\nand war, and there was nobody to whom the reins could be confided.\nLord Derby and his party would never have done, but now he had allied\nhimself with Lord Ellenborough, who was determined to have the conduct\nof the war....\nLord Aberdeen thought yet, that on him devolved the responsibility\nof replacing what he wantonly destroyed. The Queen insisted, however,\nthat Lord Aberdeen should make one appeal to the Cabinet to stand by\nher, which he promised to do to the best of his ability, but without\nhope of success. The Cabinet will meet at twelve o'clock to-day, but\nat five the Ministers will have to announce their determination to the\nHouses of Parliament, as Mr Roebuck's Motion stands for that hour.\nALBERT.",

His own friends having remained in\nthe Cabinet, is his practical condemnation. He made a very elaborate\nand dexterous statement; but which, although very plausible, did not\nproduce a good effect. It had been decided that he should be followed\nby Mr Gladstone, who was in full possession of the subject; but at the\nCabinet yesterday held before the meeting of the House, it was decided\nthat Lord Palmerston should follow Lord John, in order to prevent the\nappearance of a division in the Cabinet between the Whig and Peelite\nMembers. As Lord Palmerston was to act as Leader of the House, the\nsubstitution of Mr Gladstone would have appeared strange. But the\ndecision was unfortunate, for by all accounts the speech of Lord\nPalmerston was singularly unsuccessful.\nIn the debate which followed, the impression in the House was strongly\nagainst the War Department; and the indications which occasionally\nappeared of the possibility of Lord Palmerston filling that office\nwere received with great cordiality. Sir George Grey made an excellent\nspeech, and his censure must have been deeply felt by Lord John.\nLord Aberdeen has waited until the Cabinet had met to-day before he\nhad the honour of writing to your Majesty, in order that he might\nlearn the impressions and opinions of the Members, especially of those\nwho are in the House of Commons. All agree that if the division had\ntaken place last night, Mr Roebuck's Motion would have been carried by\na large majority.

    "body": "We went up to Buckingham Palace and saw Lord Derby at half-past\neleven. The Queen informed him of the resignation of the Government,\nand of her desire that he should try to form a new one. She addressed\nherself to him as the head of the largest Party in the House of\nCommons, and which had by its vote chiefly contributed to the\noverthrow of the Government. Lord Derby threw off this responsibility,\nsaying that there had been no communication with Mr Roebuck, but that\nhis followers could not help voting when Lord John Russell told them\non authority that there was the most ample cause for enquiry, and the\nwhole country cried out for it. Moreover, the Government, in meeting\nthe Motion, laid its chief stress upon its implying a want of\nconfidence in the Government--a confidence which they certainly did\nnot enjoy. He owned that his Party was the most compact--mustering\nabout two hundred and eighty men--but he had no men capable of\ngoverning the House of Commons, and he should not be able to present\nan Administration that would be accepted by the country unless it was\nstrengthened by other combinations; he knew that the whole country\ncried out for Lord Palmerston as the only man fit for carrying on\nthe war with success, and he owned the necessity of having him in the\nGovernment, were it even only to satisfy the French Government, the\nconfidence of which was at this moment of the greatest importance;\nbut he must say, speaking without reserve, that whatever the ignorant\npublic might think, Lord Palmerston was totally unfit for the task. He\nhad become very deaf as well as very blind, was seventy-one years\nold, and ... in fact, though he still kept up his sprightly manners\nof youth, it was evident that his day had gone by. ... Lord Derby\nthought, however, he might have the Lead of the House of Commons,\nwhich Mr Disraeli was ready to give up to him. For the War Department\nthere were but two men--both very able, but both liable to objections:\nthe first was Lord Grey, who would do it admirably, but with whom he\ndisagreed in general politics, and in this instance on the propriety\nof the war, which he himself was determined to carry on with the\nutmost vigour; then came his peculiar views about the Amalgamation\nof Offices, in which he did not at all agree. The other was Lord\nEllenborough, who was very able, and would certainly be very popular\nwith the Army, but was very unmanageable; yet he hoped he could keep\nhim in order. It might be doubtful whether Lord Hardinge could go on\nwith him at the Horse Guards. We agreed in the danger of Lord Grey's\nArmy proposal, and had to pronounce the opinion that Lord Ellenborough\nwas almost mad. This led us to a long discussion upon the merits of\nthe conduct of the war, upon which he seemed to share the general\nprejudices, but on being told some of the real facts and difficulties\nof the case, owned that these, from obvious reasons, could not be\nstated by the Government in their defence, and said that he was aware\nthat the chief fault lay at headquarters in the Crimea. Lord Raglan\nought to be recalled, as well as his whole staff, and perhaps he could\nrender this less painful to him by asking him to join the Cabinet,\nwhere his military advice would be of great value.\nTo be able to meet the House of Commons, however, Lord Derby said he\nrequired the assistance of men like Mr Gladstone and Mr S. Herbert,\nand he was anxious to know whether the Queen could tell him upon what\nsupport he could reckon in that quarter. We told him we had reason to\nbelieve the Peelites would oppose a Government of Lord John Russell,\nbut were inclined to support one of Lord Derby's; whether they were\ninclined to join in office, however, appeared very doubtful. The Queen\nhaving laid great stress on a good selection for the office of Foreign\nAffairs, Lord Derby said he would have to return to Lord Malmesbury,\nwho, he thought, had done well before, and had now additional\nexperience.\nShould he not be able to obtain strength from the Peelites, he could\nnot be able to form a creditable Government; he must give up the task,\nand thought the Queen might try some other combinations with Lord John\nRussell or Lord Lansdowne, etc.\nHe did not think a reconstruction of the old Government would be\naccepted by the country; however, whatever Government was formed to\ncarry on the war, should not only not be opposed by him, but have\nhis cordial support, provided it raised no question of general\nconstitutional importance.\nShould all attempts fail, he would be ready to come forward to the\nrescue of the country with such materials as he had, but it would be\n\"a desperate attempt.\"\nLord Derby returned a little before two from Lord Palmerston, to whom\nhe had gone in the first instance. Lord Palmerston was ready to accept\nthe Lead of the House of Commons, and acknowledged that the man\nwho undertook this could not manage the War Department besides. He\nundertook to sound Mr Gladstone and Mr S. Herbert, but had, evidently\nmuch to Lord Derby's surprise, said that it must be a coalition, and\nnot only the taking in of one or two persons, which does not seem\nto suit Lord Derby at all--nor was he pleased at Lord Palmerston's\nsuggestion that he ought to try, by all means, to retain Lord\nClarendon at the Foreign Office. Lord Palmerston was to sound the\nPeelites in the afternoon, and Lord Derby is to report the result to\nthe Queen this evening.\nVICTORIA R.",

Lord Derby said, as to\nthe independent support, it reminded him of the definition of an\nindependent Member of Parliament, viz. one that could not be depended\nupon. Under the circumstances, he would not be able to form such an\nAdministration as could effectively carry on the Government.\nHe thought that Lord Palmerston had at first been willing to join,\nbut it was now evident that the three letters had been written in\nconcert.\nHe was anxious to carry any message to any other statesman with which\nthe Queen might wish to entrust him. This the Queen declined, with her\nbest thanks. He then wanted to know what statement Lord Aberdeen would\nmake to-night in the House, stating it to be very important that it\nshould not appear that the Administration had gone from Lord Aberdeen\nthrough any other hands than the ones which should finally accept it.\nIt would be well known that he had been _consulted_ by the Queen, but\nthere was no necessity for making it appear that he had undertaken to\nform an Administration. The fact was, that he had consulted none of\nhis Party except Mr Disraeli, and that his followers would have reason\nto complain if they thought that he had put them altogether out of the\nquestion. We told him that we did not know what Lord Aberdeen meant to\nsay, but the best thing would be on all accounts to state exactly the\ntruth as it passed.\nAfter he had taken leave of the Queen with reiterated assurances of\ngratitude and loyalty, I had a further long conversation with him,\npointing out to him facts with which he could not be familiar,\nconcerning our Army in the Crimea, our relations with our Ally,\nnegotiations with the German Courts, the state of public men and the\nPress in this country, which convinced me that this country was in\na crisis of the greatest magnitude, and the Crown in the greatest\ndifficulties, which could not be successfully overcome unless\npolitical parties would show a little more patriotism than hitherto.\nThey behaved a good deal like his independent Member of Parliament,\nand tried to aggravate every little mishap in order to get Party\nadvantages out of it. I attacked him personally upon his ...\nopposition to the Foreign Enlistment Bill, and pointed to the fact\nthat the French were now obtaining the services of that very\nSwiss Legion we stood so much in need of. His defence was a mere\nParliamentary dialectic, accusing the clumsy way in which Ministers\nhad introduced their Bill, but he promised to do what he could to\nrelieve the difficulties of the country. In conclusion I showed him,\nunder injunctions of secrecy, the letter I had received from Count\nWalewski, which showed to what a state of degradation the British\nCrown had been reduced by the efforts on all sides for Party objects\nto exalt the Emperor Napoleon, and make his will and use the sole\nstandard for the English Government.\nLord Derby called it the most audacious thing he had ever seen, adding\nthat he had heard that Count Walewski had stated to somebody with\nreference to the Vienna Conferences: \"What influence can a country\nlike England pretend to exercise, which has no Army and no\nGovernment?\"\nI told him he was right, as every one here took pains to prove that\nwe had no Army, and to bring about that the Queen should have no\nGovernment.",

    "body": "Lord Lansdowne arrived late yesterday evening. The Queen, after having\nstated that Lord Derby had given up the task of forming a Government,\nasked his advice under the present circumstances, to which he replied\nthat he had little advice to give. I interrupted that at least he\ncould impart knowledge to the Queen, upon which she could form\na decision. The first and chief question was, What was Lord John\nRussell's position? Lord Lansdowne declared this to be the most\ndifficult question of all to answer. He believed Lord John was not at\nall dissatisfied with the position he had assumed, and was under the\nbelief that he could form an Administration capable of standing,\neven without the support of the Peelites. He (Lord Lansdowne) would\ncertainly decline to have anything to do with it, as it could\nreceive its support only from the extreme Radical side, which was not\nfavourable to Lord John, but shrewd enough to perceive that to obtain\na Government that would have to rest entirely upon themselves would\nbe the surest mode of pushing their own views. Lord John, although not\nintending it, would blindly follow this bias, excusing himself with\nthe consideration that he must look for support somewhere. He himself\ndoubted, however, even the possibility of Lord John succeeding; but\ntill he was brought to see this no strong Government was possible.\nWe asked about the Peelites, Lord Palmerston, etc. He did not\nknow whether the Peelites would serve with Lord John Russell--they\ncertainly would not under him. There was a strong belief, however,\nparticularly on the part of Lord Clarendon, and even shared by Lord\nPalmerston, that without Lord John a stable Government could not\nbe formed. The Queen asked whether they could unite under him (Lord\nLansdowne). He replied he had neither youth nor strength to make an\nefficient Prime Minister, and although Lord John had often told him\n\"If you had been in Aberdeen's place my position would have been quite\ndifferent,\" he felt sure Lord John would soon be tired of him and\nimpatient to see him gone. He thought an arrangement might be possible\nby which Lord Clarendon might be Prime Minister, Lord John go to the\nHouse of Lords and take the Foreign Office, and Lord Palmerston\nthe Lead in the House of Commons. We told him that would spoil two\nefficient men. Lord Clarendon had no courage for Prime Minister, and\nLord John had decidedly failed at the Foreign Office.\nLord Lansdowne had had Lord Palmerston with him during the Derby\nnegotiation, and clearly seen that at first he was not unwilling to\njoin, but had more and more cooled upon it when he went further into\nthe matter. Lord Derby and Lord Palmerston had had a full discussion\nupon Lord Grey, and discarded him as quite impracticable.... After\nmuch farther discussion it was agreed that Lord Lansdowne should go\nup to Town this day, see first Lord Palmerston, then the Peelites,\nand lastly Lord John, and come to Buckingham Palace at two o'clock,\nprepared to give answers upon the question what was feasible and what\nnot. He inclines to the belief that we shall have to go through the\nceremony at least of entrusting Lord John with the formation of an\nAdministration.\nLord John was not without large following amongst the Whigs, and\nwhatever was said about his late conduct in the higher circles,\nhe believed that it is well looked upon by the lower classes. His\nexpression was, that it would be found that the first and second class\ncarriages in the railway train held opposite opinions.",

    "body": "Lord Lansdowne arrived at two o'clock, and reported that he had seen\nall the persons intended, but he could not say that he saw his\nway more clearly. They all gave pledges generally to support any\nGovernment, but were full of difficulties as to their participation in\none.\nMr Gladstone would clearly not serve under Lord John--might possibly\nwith him--if much pressed by Lord Aberdeen to do so. He would probably\nserve under Lord Palmerston. Mr S. Herbert expressed apprehension at\nthe effect upon the prospects of peace which would be produced by Lord\nPalmerston's being at the head of the Government.\nLord John Russell would not serve under Lord Palmerston, and fancies\nhe might form a Whig Administration himself, of which Lord Palmerston,\nhowever, must be the chief member. Lord Palmerston would not like\nto serve under Lord John Russell--would be ready to form an\nAdministration, which could not have duration, however, in his\nopinion, if Lord John Russell held aloof!\nHe found Lord John fully impressed with the fact of his having\nbrought the Queen into all these difficulties, and of owing her what\nreparation he could make. Lord Palmerston also felt that he had\nsome amends to make to the Queen for former offences. We asked Lord\nLansdowne whether they could not be combined under a third person. He\nfelt embarrassed about the answer, having to speak of himself. Both\nexpressed their willingness to serve under him--but then he was\nseventy-five years old, and crippled with the gout, and could not\npossibly undertake such a task except for a few months, when the whole\nAdministration would break down--of which he did not wish to be the\ncause. In such a case, Lord John had stated to him that the man to be\nLeader of the House of Commons was Lord Palmerston, meaning himself\nto be transferred to the House of Lords, in his former office as\nPresident of the Council.\nWithout presuming to give advice, Lord Lansdowne thought that under\nall circumstances it would do good if the Queen was to see Lord John\nRussell, and hear from himself what he could do. She could perfectly\nkeep it in her power to commission whom she pleased hereafter, even if\nLord John should declare himself willing to form a Government.\nVICTORIA R.",

    "body": "Lord John Russell came at five o'clock.\nThe Queen said she wished to consult him on the present crisis, and\nhear from him how the position of Parties stood at this moment. He\nsaid that immediately at the meeting of Parliament a general desire\nbecame manifest for a modification of the Government; that the\nProtectionists were as hostile to the Peelites as they had been in the\nyear '46; that the old Whigs had with difficulty been made to support\nthe late Government; that the dissatisfaction with the conduct of the\nwar was general, and the country cried out for Lord Palmerston at the\nWar Department; that he considered it of the greatest importance\nthat Lord Clarendon should remain at the Foreign Office, where he had\ngained great reputation, and nobody could replace him. On the\nquestion whether Lord Palmerston would be supported if he formed an\nAdministration, he said everybody would give a general support, but he\ndoubted the Whigs joining him. He did not know what the Peelites\nwould do, but they would be an essential element in the Government,\nparticularly Mr Gladstone; the best thing would be if Lord Palmerston\ntook the lead of the House of Commons. A Government formed by Lord\nLansdowne or Lord Clarendon would ensure general support, but Lord\nLansdowne had declared that he would not undertake it for more than\nthree months, and then the Government would break down again; and we\nobjected that Lord Clarendon ought, as he had said, not to be moved\nfrom the Foreign Office, to which he agreed. He himself would prefer\nto sit on the Fourth Bench and support the Government. The Queen asked\nhim whether he thought he could form a Government. After having taken\nsome time for reflection, he said he thought he could, but he\nthought it difficult without the Peelites, and next to impossible\nwithout Lord Palmerston; he did not know whether both or either would\nserve with or under him; he would offer Lord Palmerston the choice\nbetween the Lead of the House of Commons and the War Department--and\nin case he should choose the former, ask himself to be removed to the\nHouse of Lords; he had been Leader of the House of Commons since '34,\nand as far as being able to support his title, he was enabled to do\nso, as his brother, the Duke of Bedford, intended to leave an estate\nof \u00a35000 a year to his son. The Queen asked him whether he would do\nthe same under the Administration of Lord Lansdowne, for instance;\nhe begged to be allowed time to consider that. He acknowledged to the\nQueen--on her remark that he had contributed to bring her into the\npresent difficulties--that he was bound to do what he could to help\nher out of them; and on the Queen's question what he could do, he\nanswered that depended very much on what the Queen would wish him to\ndo.\nShe commissioned him finally to meet Lord Lansdowne and Lord\nPalmerston, to consult together, and to let Lord Lansdowne bring her\nthe result of their deliberation this evening, so that she might see a\nlittle more clearly where the prospect of a strong Government lay.\nWe had some further discussion upon Mr Roebuck's Committee, which\nhe thinks will not be as inconvenient as all his friends suppose.\nIt would meet with great difficulties, and might be precluded from\ndrawing up a report. On Lord Grey's Motion and the Army question\nhe declared that he held to his Memorandum of the 22nd January which\nthe Duke of Newcastle had read to the House of Lords, and acknowledged\nthe necessity of maintaining the office of the Commander-in-Chief,\nalthough subordinate to the Secretary of State, and retaining the Army\nPatronage distinct from the Political Patronage of the Government.\nI omitted to mention that Lord John, in answer to the question whether\nLord Clarendon would serve under Lord Palmerston, answered that he\ncould not at all say whether he would; he had mentioned to him the\npossibility, when Lord Clarendon drew up and made a long face.\nVICTORIA R.",

They then discussed the whole question of\noffices, agreed that Lord Panmure would be the best person for the War\nDepartment; that Lord Grey could not be asked to join, as his views\non the Foreign Policy differed so much from theirs, and he had always\nbeen an intractable colleague; that if Mr Gladstone could not be\nprevailed upon to join, Mr Labouchere, although an infinitely\nweaker appointment, might be Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Sir F.\nBaring replace Sir J. Graham, if he could not be got to stay.\nLord John then saw Mr S.

Lord John thought that the expression of a wish on\nthe part of the Queen would go a great way to reconcile him. His\nobjections were that he had always received the handsomest support\nfrom the Peelites, and thought the Government too weak without their\nadministrative ability.\nLord John had seen none of his own friends, such as Sir G.

    "body": "In the Audience which the Queen has just granted to Lord Palmerston,\nhe thanked her for the message which she had sent him through Lord\nJohn Russell, and declared his readiness to serve her in any way he\ncould under the present difficulties. He had preferred the lead of\nthe House of Commons to the War Department, having to make a choice\nbetween two duties which no man could perform together.\nIn answer to a question from the Queen, he said he hoped that the\npresent irritation in the Whig party would subside, and that he would\nbe able to complete a Government. He regretted that the Peelites\nthought it impossible for them to join, which would make it very\ndifficult for Lord John. He had just heard from Count Walewski that\nLord Clarendon was very much disinclined to remain at the Foreign\nOffice under Lord John. They were to have a meeting at Lord John's at\nfive, where he hoped to find that he had waived his objections; but he\nmust say that if Lord Clarendon persisted he must himself withdraw, as\nhe had indeed made it a condition with Lord John. The Queen asked him\nwhether, if this attempt failed, she could reckon upon his services in\nany other combination. His answer was that it was better not to answer\nfor more than one question at a time; we must now suppose that this\nwill succeed.\nWhat he stated with reference to the Army question and the Committee\nof the House of Commons was perfectly satisfactory.\nLord Clarendon, whom we saw at four o'clock, complained very much of\nthe unfairness of Lord John in making him personally answerable for\nimpeding the progress of Lord John's Government. The fact was that his\nopinion was only that of every other member of the late Government,\nand of the public at large; which could be heard and seen by anybody\nwho chose to listen or to read. So impossible had it appeared to the\npublic that Lord John should be blind enough to consider his being\nable to form a Government feasible, that it was generally supposed\nthat he had been urged to do so by the Queen, in order to escape\nthe necessity of Lord Palmerston. He acknowledged that the Queen's\ndecision in that respect had been the perfectly correct and\nconstitutional one, and perhaps necessary to clear the way; but he\nhoped that for her own sake, and to prevent false impressions\ntaking root in the public mind, the Queen would give afterwards Lord\nPalmerston his fair turn also, though he could not say that he would\nbe able to form an Administration. The Queen said that this was her\nintention, that she never had expected that Lord John would be able\nto form one, but that it was necessary that his eyes should be opened;\nLord Clarendon only regretted the precious time that was lost.\nHe must really say that he thought he could do no good in joining Lord\nJohn; his Government would be \"a stillborn Government,\" which \"the\ncountry would tread under foot the first day,\" composed as it would be\nof the same men who had been bankrupt in 1852, minus the two best men\nin it, viz. Lord Lansdowne and Lord Grey, and the head of it ruined\nin public opinion. If he were even to stay at the Foreign Office, his\nlanguage to foreign countries would lose all its weight from being\nknown not to rest upon the public opinion of England, and all this\nwould become much worse when it became known that from the first day\nof Lord John's entering into Lord Aberdeen's Government, he had only\nhad one idea, viz. that of tripping him up, expel the Peelites, and\nplace himself at the head of an exclusive Whig Ministry. Besides,\nhe felt that the conduct of all his colleagues had been most\nstraightforward and honourable towards him, and he was not prepared\n\"to step over their dead bodies to the man who had killed them.\" The\nattempt of Lord John ought _not_ to succeed if public morality were\nto be upheld in this country. He had avoided Lord John ever since his\nretirement, but he would have now to speak out to him, as when he was\nasked to embark his honour he had a right to count the cost.\nLord Lansdowne had no intention to go to Lord John's meeting, as he\nhad originally taken leave of public life, and had only entered the\nCoalition Government in order to facilitate its cohesion; among a\nGovernment of pure Whigs he was not wanted, for there was no danger\nof their not _cohering_. Sir C. Wood declared he had no business to be\nwhere Lord Lansdowne refused to go in.\nHe thought Lord Palmerston would have equal difficulty in forming an\nadministration, but when that had failed some solid combination would\nbecome possible.\nLord Lansdowne had declared that he could not place himself at the\nhead for more than three months, but that was a long time in these\ndays.\nVICTORIA R.",

Graham,\nwhom he had visited, had informed him that the feeling against him was\nvery strong just now, precluding support in Parliament; he gave him\ncredit for good intentions, but said the whole difficulty was owing\nto what he termed his (Lord John's) _rashness_. He felt he could not\nseparate from Lord Aberdeen, and had no confidence in the views of\nForeign Affairs of Lord Palmerston.\nHe had then seen Sir George Grey, who told him he had no idea that\na Government of Lord John's could stand at this moment; the country\nwanted Lord Palmerston either as War Minister or as Prime Minister.\nHe must hesitate to engage himself in Lord John's Government, which,\nseparated from the Peelites, would find no favour.

They were one and all for the vigorous\nprosecution of the war, but in order to attain a speedy peace. Lord\nPalmerston was known to entertain ulterior views, on which he was\nsecretly agreed with the Emperor of the French; and when it came to\nthe question of negotiations, the Government was sure to break up on\na ground most dangerous to the country. Lord Lansdowne could but agree\nin all this, and added he had been tempted to feel his pulse to know\nhow much it had gone down since he had been with Sir James.\nThe meeting between Lord Palmerston and Lord John had just taken place\nin his presence. They had discussed everything most openly, but being\nboth very guarded to say nothing which could lead the other to believe\nthat the one would serve under the other. He confessed everything was\ndarker now than before.

It\nwas very important that it should not appear that the Queen had any\npersonal objection to Lord Palmerston; on the other hand, under such\ndoubtful circumstances, it would be safest for the Queen to follow\nthat course which was clearly the most constitutional, and this was,\nafter having failed with Lord Derby, to go to Lord John, who was the\nother party to the destruction of the late Government.

    "body": "We came to Town to hear the result of negotiations, and saw Lord\nPalmerston at one o'clock. He said there were circumstances which\nprevented him from submitting a List of the Cabinet, but would at all\nevents be able to do so in the afternoon.\nLords Lansdowne, Clarendon, Granville, Sir G. Grey, Sir C. Wood,\nSir William Molesworth, and the Chancellor had consented to\nserve--unconditionally--having withdrawn their former conditions in\nconsequence of the very general opinion expressed out of doors that\nthe country could not much longer be left without a Government. He\nheard this had also made an impression upon the Peelites, who had\nrefused to join. He submitted their letters (declining) to the\nQueen, of which copies are here annexed. They had been written after\nconsultation with Sir J. Graham, but Lord Aberdeen and the Duke of\nNewcastle having heard of it, have since exerted themselves strongly\nto prevail upon them to change their opinion, and it was still\npossible that they would do so. Lord Clarendon had suggested that if\nLord Aberdeen himself was invited to join the Government, and could\nbe induced to do so, this would obviate all difficulty. He had in\nconsequence asked Lord Lansdowne to see Lord Aberdeen on the subject,\nas his joining could only be agreeable to him. Many of the Peelites\nnot in the late Cabinet had strongly disapproved of the decision\ntaken by Mr Gladstone and friends, and offered their services, amongst\nothers Lord Canning, Lord Elcho, and Mr Cardwell.\nLord Palmerston had been with Lord John Russell yesterday, and had had\na very long conversation with him in a most friendly tone; he asked\nLord John whether he would follow out the proposal which he had lately\nmade himself, and take the lead in the House of Lords as President of\nthe Council. He declined, however, saying he preferred to stay out of\noffice and to remain in the House of Commons, which Lord Palmerston\nobviously much regretted. They went, however, together all over the\noffices and their best distribution. He would recommend Lord Panmure\nfor the War Department and Mr Layard as Under Secretary.... Lord\nPalmerston was appointed to report further progress at five o'clock.\nVICTORIA R.",

    "body": "MY DEAR HERBERT,--I received your letter too late to answer it last\nnight. In fact, I had gone to bed.\nYou say that you are in a great difficulty as to the course you ought\nto take. I am in none whatever.\nI gave you my decided opinion yesterday that you ought to continue in\nPalmerston's Administration; and I endeavoured to support this opinion\nby the very arguments which you repeat in your letter to me. Surely\nthis letter ought to have been addressed to Gladstone and Graham,\nand not to me. I fully concur in thinking that you came to a wrong\nconclusion yesterday, and I would fain hope that it would still be\nreversed.\nWhen you sent to me yesterday to attend your meeting, I certainly\nhoped it was with the intention of following my advice.\nYour reluctance to continue in Palmerston's Cabinet is chiefly founded\non the apprehension that he will pursue a warlike policy beyond\nreasonable bounds. I have already told you that I have had some\nexplanations with him on the terms of peace, with which I am\nsatisfied. But whatever may be his inclinations, you ought to rely\non the weight of your own character and opinions in the Cabinet. I am\npersuaded that the sentiments of the great majority of the Members of\nthe Cabinet are similar to your own, and that you may fairly expect\nreason and sound policy to prevail in the question of peace and war.\nBut above all I have recently had some very full conversations\nwith Clarendon on the subject, and I am entirely satisfied with his\ndisposition and intentions. I am sanguine in the belief that he will\ngive effect to his present views.\nA perseverance in the refusal to join Palmerston will produce very\nserious effects, and will never be attributed to its true cause. The\npublic feeling will be strongly pronounced against you, and you will\ngreatly suffer in reputation, if you persevere at such a moment as\nthis in refusing to continue in the Cabinet.\nIn addition to the public necessity, I think you owe much to our late\nWhig colleagues, who behaved so nobly and generously towards us\nafter Lord John's resignation. They have some right to expect this\nsacrifice.\nAlthough your arguments do not apply to me, for I yesterday adopted\nthem all, you conclude your letter by pressing me to enter the\nCabinet. Now there is really no sense in this, and I cannot imagine\nhow you can seriously propose it. You would expose me to a gratuitous\nindignity, to which no one ought to expect me to submit. I say\n_gratuitous_, because I could not be of the slightest use in such a\nsituation for the purpose you require.\nI can retire with perfect equanimity from the Government in\nconsequence of the vote of the House of Commons; but to be stigmatised\nas the Head and tolerated as the subordinate member I cannot endure.\nIf at any future time my presence should be required in a Cabinet, I\nshould feel no objection to accept any office, or to enter it without\noffice. But to be the Head of a Cabinet to-day, and to become a\nsubordinate member of the very same Cabinet to-morrow, would be a\ndegradation to which I could never submit, that I would rather die\nthan do so--and indeed the sense of it would go far to kill me.\nIf you tell me that your retaining your present offices, without the\nslightest sacrifice, but on the contrary with the approbation of all,\nis in any degree to depend on my taking such a course, I can only\nsay that, as friends, I cannot believe it possible that you should be\nguilty of such wanton cruelty without any national object.\nI must, then, again earnestly exhort you to reconsider the decision of\nyesterday, and to continue to form part of the Government. I will do\nanything in my power to facilitate this. If you like, I will go to\nPalmerston and promote any explanation between him and Gladstone on\nthe subject of peace and war. Or I will tell him that you have yielded\nto my strong recommendation. In short, I am ready to do anything in my\npower.\nI wish you to show this letter to Gladstone and to Graham, to whom, as\nyou will see, it is addressed as much as to yourself.\nI hope to meet you this morning, and Gladstone will also come to the\nAdmiralty. Yours, etc.\nABERDEEN.",

It is considered by the Members of the proposed\nCabinet to be a matter of great importance that Lord Lansdowne should\nnot only be a Member of the Cabinet, but that he should also be the\nOrgan of the Government in the House of Lords.\nViscount Palmerston pressed this upon Lord Lansdowne yesterday\nafternoon, and was under the impression that Lord Lansdowne had\nconsented to be so acknowledged, with the understanding that Lord\nGranville, as President of the Council, should relieve him from the\npressure of the daily business of the House, while Lord Clarendon\nwould take the burthen of Foreign Office discussions, and that thus\nthe ordinary duties of Leader of the House of Lords would be performed\nby others, while Lord Lansdowne would still be the directing chief,\nwho would give a character and tone to the body. But Viscount\nPalmerston learns this morning from Lord Granville and Lord\nBessborough that Lord Lansdowne does not so understand the matter,\nand is unwilling to assume the ostensible Leadership, even upon the\nabove-mentioned arrangement, and that he wishes Lord Granville to be\nthe Leader in the House of Lords.\nLord Granville, however, with reason urges that there are many members\nof the House of Lords who would show to Lord Lansdowne, from his long\nstanding and high political position, a deference which they would not\nshow towards Lord Granville, so much younger a man. If Lord Lansdowne\nwere in Town, Viscount Palmerston would have gone to him strongly to\nentreat him to be the person to announce in the House of Lords the\nformation of a Ministry, and to continue to be the organ of the\nGovernment in that House, at least till Easter, and upon such matters\nand occasions as might require the weight of his authority; but if\nyour Majesty were to view the matter in the same light in which it has\npresented itself to Viscount Palmerston, to the Chancellor, to Lord\nClarendon, to Lord Granville and others, and if your Majesty should\nthink fit to express an opinion upon it to Lord Lansdowne, such an\nopinion would no doubt have great weight with Lord Lansdowne.\nViscount Palmerston submits a list of the proposed Cabinet. Until Sir\nGeorge Grey returns to Town this afternoon from Portsmouth, whither he\nwent yesterday evening to take leave of his son, who has a commission\nin the Rifles, and was to embark this morning for the Crimea,\nViscount Palmerston will not know whether he prefers the Colonial\nOffice or the Home Office.

He begged that I should rest\nassured that the first and primary consideration which would guide\ntheir determination would be the position of the Crown in these\ncritical circumstances. He had had no opportunity of consulting these\nlast days either Mr S. Herbert or Sir James Graham. But for himself he\nfelt the greatest difficulty in letting the House of Commons succeed\nin what he must consider a most unconstitutional, most presumptuous,\nand most dangerous course, after which it would be impossible for\nthe Executive ever to oppose again the most absurd and preposterous\ndemands for enquiry.\nI asked, \"But can you stop it?\"\nHe answered: I believe Lord Palmerston made a mistake in not grappling\nwith it from the first, and using all the power the Crown had\nentrusted to him, even ostentatiously, for the purpose. Now it might\nbe most difficult--but it ought not to pass without a solemn protest\non the part of the men who were not connected with the Government,\nand should not be supposed to have any other than the interests of\nthe Country at heart. A Government was powerless in resisting such an\nencroachment of the House, where the whole Opposition, from personal\nmotives, and the supporters of Government from fear of their\nconstituents, were bent upon carrying it. Such a protest, however,\nmight form a rallying-point upon which future resistance might be\nbased, and the Country, now intoxicated by agitation, might come to\nits senses.\nAs to the strength of the Government, he believed it had very little\nat this moment in the House, and that such would be the case with any\nGovernment Lord Palmerston could form, he had foretold him, when Lord\nDerby had made him the offer to join an Administration of his forming.\nAt this moment the secession of the Peelites would rather strengthen\nthe Government than otherwise, as, from their connection with Lord\nAberdeen, they had been decried in the Country with him, and the Whigs\nlooked upon them with all the personal feelings of men deprived of\ntheir offices by them.\nHe agreed with me that in the present disruption of Parties, the\ndifficulty of obtaining any strong Government consists, not in the\npaucity of men, but in the over-supply of Right Honourable gentlemen\nproduced by the many attempts to form a Government on a more extended\nbase. There were now at least three Ministers for each office, from\nwhich the two excluded were always cried up as superior to the one\nin power. He said this could not be amended until we got back to two\nParties--each of them capable of presenting to the Queen an efficient\nAdministration. Now the one Party did not support its Chief from\npersonal rivalry--and the other, from the very feeling of its own\nincapacity, became reckless as to the course of its political actions.\nHe concluded by saying he felt it right to reserve his final\ndetermination till the last moment at which it would become necessary.\nALBERT.",

We have lost our\n_three_ best men--certainly from the purest and best of motives--but\nthe result is _unfortunate_. Altogether, affairs are very unsettled\nand very unsatisfactory. The good people here are really a little\n_mad_, but I am certain it _will_ right itself; one must only _not_\ngive way to the nonsense and absurdity one hears.\nLord John's return to office _under_ Lord Palmerston is very\nextraordinary! I hope he may do good in his mission; he is most\nanxious for it.\nMany thanks for your kind letter of the 23rd. The frost has left us,\nwhich personally I regret, as it agrees so well with me; but I believe\nit was very necessary on account of the great distress which was\nprevalent, so many people being thrown out of employment.\nThe Emperor's meditated voyage--though natural in him to wish--I\nthink most alarming; in fact, I don't know how things are to go on\nwithout him, independent of the great danger he exposes himself\nto besides. I own it makes one tremble, for _his life_ is of such\n_immense importance_. I still hope that he may be deterred from it,\nbut Walewski was in a great state about it.\nOn Thursday we saw twenty-six of the wounded Coldstream Guards, and\non Friday thirty-four of the Scotch Fusileers. A most interesting and\ntouching sight--_such_ fine men, and so brave and patient! _so ready_\nto go back and \"_be at them again_.\" A great many of them, I am glad\nto say, will be able to remain in the Service. Those who have lost\ntheir limbs cannot, of course. There were two poor boys of nineteen\nand twenty--the one had lost his leg, quite high up, by the bursting\nof a shell in the trenches, and the other his poor arm so shot that it\nis perfectly useless. Both had smooth girls' faces; these were in the\nColdstream, who certainly look the worst. In the Scotch Fusileers,\nthere were also two very young men--the one shot through the\ncheek, the other through the _skull_--but both recovered! Among the\nGrenadiers there is one very sad object, shot _dreadfully_, a ball\nhaving gone in through the cheek and behind the nose and eye and out\nthrough the other side! He is shockingly disfigured, but is recovered.\nI feel so much for them, and am _so fond_ of my dear soldiers--so\n_proud_ of them! We could not have avoided sending the Guards; it\nwould have been their ruin if they had not gone....\nI must now conclude. Ever your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

It is possible that the new Emperor may revert to that\npeaceful policy which he was understood to advocate in the beginning\nof these transactions, but it is possible, on the other hand, that\nhe may feel bound to follow out the policy of his father, and may be\nimpelled by the headstrong ambition of his brother Constantine. At all\nevents, this change at Petersburg should not for the present slacken\nthe proceedings and the arrangements of the Allies.\nThe House of Commons has been engaged in discussing Mr Roebuck's\nproposal that the Committee of Enquiry should be a secret one. This\nproposal was made by the majority of the Committee on the ground that\nthey anticipated a difficulty in conducting their enquiries without\ntrenching on the delicate and dangerous ground of questioning the\nproceedings of the French. The proposal was objected to by Lord\nSeymour and Mr Ellice, members of the Committee, by Sir James\nGraham as unjust towards the Duke of Newcastle, and others whose\nconduct ought to be enquired into with all the safeguards which\npublicity secures for justice, and not before a Secret Tribunal in the\nnature of an Inquisition. The general sense of the House was against\nsecrecy, and Viscount Palmerston expressed an opinion adverse to it,\non the ground that it could not be enforced because the Committee\ncould not gag the witnesses, and that the character of secrecy\nwould excite suspicion and disappoint public expectation.

    "body": "Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\nto state that the Members of the Cabinet who met yesterday evening at\nthe Chancellor's were of opinion that the Austrian proposal adopted by\nM. Drouyn de Lhuys, even with his pretended modification, could not\nbe described more accurately than in the concise terms of H.R.H.\nthe Prince Albert, namely, that instead of making to cease the\npreponderance of Russia in the Black Sea, it would perpetuate and\nlegalise that preponderance, and that instead of establishing a secure\nand permanent Peace, it would only establish a prospective case for\nwar. Such a proposal therefore your Majesty's Advisers could not\nrecommend your Majesty to adopt; but as the step to be taken seems\nrather to be to make such a proposal to Austria than to answer such\na proposal which Austria has not formally made, and as M. Drouyn's\ntelegraphic despatch stated that he thought that Lord John Russell\nwould recommend such an arrangement to his colleagues, the Cabinet\nwere of opinion that the best course would be simply to take no\nstep at all until Lord John Russell's return, which may be expected\nto-morrow or next day, especially as Lord Clarendon had already, by\ntelegraphic message of yesterday, intimated to the French Government\nthat such an arrangement as that proposed by M. Drouyn, and which\nwould sanction a Russian Fleet in the Black Sea to any amount short by\none ship of the number existing in 1853, could not be agreed to by\nthe British Government. Such an arrangement would, in the opinion of\nViscount Palmerston, be alike dangerous and dishonourable; and as\nto the accompanying alliance with Austria for the future defence of\nTurkey and for making war with Russia, if she were to raise her Black\nSea Fleet up to the amount of 1853, what reason is there to believe\nthat Austria, who shrinks from war with Russia now that the Army\nof Russia has been much reduced by the losses of the last twelve\nmonths--now that her Forces are divided and occupied elsewhere than on\nthe Austrian frontier, and now that England and France are actually in\nthe field with great Armies, supported by great Fleets, what reason\nis there to believe that this same Austria would be more ready to\nmake war four or five years hence, when the Army of Russia shall have\nrepaired its losses and shall be more concentrated to attack\nAustria, when the Austrian Army shall have been reduced to its Peace\nEstablishment, and when the Peace Establishments of England and\nFrance, withdrawn within their home stations, shall be less ready to\nco-operate with Austria in war? What reason, moreover, is there for\nsupposing that Austria, who has recently declared that though prepared\nfor war she will not make war for ten sail of the Line more or less\nin the Russian Black Sea Fleet, will some few years hence, when\nunprepared for war, draw the sword on account of the addition of one\nship of war to the Russian Fleet in the Black Sea?\nSuch proposals are really a mockery.",

The\n_attentat_ on the Emperor will have shocked you, as it did us; it\nshocked me _the more_ as we had _watched over_ him with such anxiety\nwhile he was with us.\nIt has produced an immense sensation in France, we hear, and many of\n_his_ political _enemies_, he says, cheered him loudly as he returned\nto the Tuileries. As you say, he is _very personal_, and _therefore_\nkindness _shown_ him _personally_ will make a _lasting_ effect on his\nmind, peculiarly susceptible to _kindness_. Another feature in his\ncharacter is that _il ne fait pas de phrases_--and _what_ is said\nis the result of deep reflection. I therefore send you (in _strict\nconfidence_) a copy of the really very kind letter he wrote me,\nand which I am sure is _quite sincere_. He felt the simple and kind\ntreatment of him and her _more_ than _all_ the outward homage and\ndisplay.\nPlease kindly to return it when you have done with it.\nI am sure you would be charmed with the Empress; it is not such great\nbeauty, but such grace, elegance, sweetness, and _nature_. Her manners\nare charming; the _profile_ and figure beautiful and particularly\n_distingu\u00e9s_.\nYou will be pleased (as I was) at the abandonment of the journey to\nthe Crimea, though I think, as regarded the Campaign, it would have\nbeen a good thing....\nLord John is returned.

    "body": "The recent visit of the Emperor Napoleon III. to this country is a\nmost curious page of history, and gives rise to many reflections. A\nremarkable combination of circumstances has brought about the very\nintimate alliance which now unites England and France, for so many\ncenturies the bitterest enemies and rivals, and this, under the reign\nof the present Emperor, the nephew of our greatest foe, and bearing\nhis name, and brought about by the policy of the late Emperor of\nRussia, who considered himself as the head of the European Alliance\nagainst France!\nIn reflecting on the character of the present Emperor Napoleon, and\nthe impression I have conceived of it, the following thoughts present\nthemselves to my mind:\nThat he _is_ a very _extraordinary_ man, with great qualities\nthere can be _no_ doubt--I might almost say a mysterious man. He is\nevidently possessed of _indomitable courage_, _unflinching firmness\nof purpose_, _self-reliance_, _perseverance_, and _great secrecy_; to\nthis should be added, a great reliance on what he calls his _Star_,\nand a belief in omens and incidents as connected with his future\ndestiny, which is almost romantic--and at the same time he is endowed\nwith wonderful _self-control_, great _calmness_, even _gentleness_,\nand with a _power_ of _fascination_, the effect of which upon\nall those who become more intimately acquainted with him is _most\nsensibly_ felt.\nHow far he is actuated by a strong _moral_ sense of _right_ and\n_wrong_ is difficult to say. On the one hand, his attempts at\nStrasbourg and Boulogne, and this last after having given a solemn\npromise never to return or make a similar attempt--in which he openly\ncalled on the subjects of the then King of the French to follow him\nas the successor of Napoleon, the _Coup d'\u00c9tat_ of December 1851,\nfollowed by great ... severity and the confiscation of the property of\nthe unfortunate Orleans family, would lead one to believe that he is\nnot. On the other hand, his kindness and gratitude towards all those,\nwhether high or low, who have befriended him or stood by him through\nlife, and his straightforward and steady conduct towards us throughout\nthe very difficult and anxious contest in which we have been engaged\nfor a year and a half, show that he is possessed of noble and right\nfeelings.\nMy impression is, that in all these apparently inexcusable acts, he\nhas invariably been guided by the belief that he is _fulfilling a\ndestiny_ which God has _imposed_ upon him, and that, though cruel or\nharsh in themselves, they were _necessary_ to obtain the result which\nhe considered _himself_ as _chosen_ to carry out, and _not_ acts of\n_wanton_ cruelty or injustice; for it is impossible to know him and\nnot to see that there is much that is truly amiable, kind, and honest\nin his character. Another remarkable and important feature in his\ncomposition is, that everything he says or expresses is the _result_\nof deep reflection and of settled purpose, and not merely _des phrases\nde politesse_, consequently when we read words used in his speech\nmade in the City, we may feel sure that he _means_ what he says; and\ntherefore I would rely with confidence on his behaving honestly and\nfaithfully towards us. I am not able to say whether he is deeply\nversed in History--I should rather think not, as regards it\n_generally_, though he may be, and probably is, well informed in\nthe history of his own country, certainly fully so in that of the\n_Empire_, he having made it his special study to contemplate and\nreflect upon all the acts and designs of his great uncle. He is very\nwell read in German literature, to which he seems to be very partial.\nIt is said, and I am inclined to think with truth, that he reads but\nlittle, even as regards despatches from his own foreign Ministers, he\nhaving expressed his surprise at my reading them daily. He seems to\nbe singularly ignorant in matters not connected with the branch of\nhis _special_ studies, and to be ill informed upon them by those who\nsurround him.\nIf we compare him with poor King Louis Philippe, I should say that the\nlatter (Louis Philippe) was possessed of vast knowledge upon all and\nevery subject, of immense experience in public affairs, and of great\nactivity of mind; whereas the Emperor possesses greater judgment and\nmuch greater firmness of purpose, but no experience of public affairs,\nnor mental application; he is endowed, as was the late King, with much\nfertility of imagination.\nAnother great difference between King Louis Philippe and the\nEmperor is, that the poor King was _thoroughly French_ in character,\npossessing all the liveliness and talkativeness of that people,\nwhereas the Emperor is as _unlike_ a _Frenchman_ as possible, being\nmuch more _German_ than French in character.... How could it be\nexpected that the Emperor _should_ have any _experience_ in _public\naffairs_, considering that till six years ago he lived as a poor\nexile, for some years even in prison, and never having taken the\nslightest part in the _public_ affairs of _any_ country?\nIt is therefore the more astounding, indeed almost incomprehensible,\nthat he should show all those powers of Government, and all that\nwonderful tact in his conduct and manners which he evinces, and which\nmany a King's son, nurtured in palaces and educated in the midst of\naffairs, never succeeds in attaining. I likewise believe that he would\nbe incapable of such tricks and over-reachings as practised by poor\nKing Louis Philippe (for whose memory, as the old and kind friend of\nmy father, and of whose kindness and amiable qualities I shall ever\nretain a lively sense), who in great as well as in small things took\na pleasure in being cleverer and more cunning than others, often\nwhen there was no advantage to be gained by it, and which was,\nunfortunately, strikingly displayed in the transactions connected with\nthe Spanish marriages, which led to the King's downfall and ruined\nhim in the eyes of all Europe. On the other hand, I believe that the\nEmperor Napoleon would not hesitate to do a thing by main force,\neven if in itself unjust and tyrannical, should he consider that the\n_accomplishment of his destiny_ demanded it.\nThe _great advantage_ to be derived for the permanent alliance\nof England and France, which is of such vital importance to both\ncountries, by the Emperor's recent visit, I take to be this: that,\nwith his peculiar character and views, which are very personal, a\nkind, unaffected, and hearty reception by us _personally_ in our own\nfamily will make a lasting impression upon his mind; he will see\nthat he can rely upon our friendship and honesty towards him and his\ncountry so long as he remains faithful towards us; naturally frank,\nhe will see the advantage to be derived from continuing so; and if he\nreflects on the downfall of the former dynasty, he will see that it\narose _chiefly_ from a _breach_ of pledges,... and will be sure, if I\nbe not very much mistaken in his character, to _avoid_ such a course.\nIt must likewise not be overlooked that this kindly feeling towards\nus, and consequently towards England (the interests of which are\n_inseparable_ from us), must be increased when it is remembered that\n_we_ are almost the only people in _his_ own position with whom he has\nbeen able to be on any terms of intimacy, consequently almost the only\nones to whom he could talk easily and unreservedly, which he cannot\ndo naturally with his inferiors. He and the Empress are in a most\nisolated position, unable to trust the only relations who are near\nthem in France, and surrounded by courtiers and servants, who from\nfear or interest do not tell them the truth. It is, therefore, natural\nto believe that he will not willingly separate from those who, like\nus, do not scruple to put him in possession of the real facts, and\nwhose conduct is guided by justice and honesty, and this the more\nreadily as he is supposed to have always been a searcher after truth.\nI would go still further, and think that it is in our power to _keep_\nhim in the right course, and to protect him against the extreme\nflightiness, changeableness, and to a certain extent want of honesty\nof his own servants and nation. We should never lose the opportunity\nof checking in the bud any attempt on the part of his agents or\nministers to play us false, frankly informing him of the facts, and\nencouraging him to bring forward in an equally frank manner whatever\nhe has to complain of. This is the course which we have hitherto\npursued, and as he is France in his own sole person, it becomes of the\nutmost importance to encourage by every means in our power that very\nopen intercourse which I must say has existed between him and Lord\nCowley for the last year and a half, and now, since our personal\nacquaintance, between ourselves.\nAs I said before, the words which fall from his lips are the result of\ndeep reflection, and part of the deep plan which he has staked out\nfor himself, and which he intends to carry out. I would therefore lay\nstress on the following words which he pronounced to me immediately\nafter the investiture of the Order of the Garter: \"_C'est un lien de\nplus entre nous, j'ai pr\u00eat\u00e9 serment de fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 \u00e0 votre Majest\u00e9 et\nje le garderai soigneusement. C'est un grand \u00e9v\u00e9nement pour moi, et\nj'esp\u00e8re pouvoir prouver ma reconnaissance envers votre Majest\u00e9 et son\nPays._\" In a letter said to be written by him to Mr F. Campbell, the\ntranslator of M. Thiers's _History of the Consulate and Empire_, when\nreturning the proof-sheets in 1847, he says \"Let us hope the day may\nyet come when I shall carry out the intentions of my Uncle by uniting\nthe policy and interests of England and France in an indissoluble\nalliance. That hope cheers and encourages me. It forbids my repining\nat the altered fortunes of my family.\"\nIf these be truly his words, he certainly has acted up to them, since\nhe has swayed with an iron hand the destinies of that most versatile\nnation, the French. That he should have written this at a moment when\nLouis Philippe had succeeded in all his wishes, and seemed securer\nthan ever in the possession of his Throne, shows a calm reliance in\nhis destiny and in the realisation of hopes entertained from his very\nchildhood which borders on the supernatural.\nThese are a few of the many reflections caused by the observation and\nacquaintance with the character of this most extraordinary man, in\nwhose fate not only the interests of this country, but the whole of\nEurope are intimately bound up. I shall be curious to see if, after\nthe lapse of time, my opinion and estimate of it has been the right\none.\nVICTORIA R.",

From the highest Prince of the Blood\nto the lowest Private, all received the same distinction for the\nbravest conduct in the severest actions, and the rough hand of the\nbrave and honest private soldier came for the first time in contact\nwith that of their Sovereign and their Queen!

She writes to him, therefore,\nto-day, for the _first_ time as the Commander-in-Chief of her heroic\nArmy in the East, to assure him of her confidence and support. It is\nas proud a command as any soldier could desire, but its difficulties\nand responsibilities are also very great.\nGeneral Simpson knows well how admirably his lamented predecessor\nconducted all the communications with our Allies the French, and he\ncannot do better than follow in the same course. While showing the\ngreatest readiness to act with perfect cordiality towards them, he\nwill, the Queen trusts, never allow her Army to be unduly pressed\nupon, which would only injure both Armies.\nThe Queen feels very anxious lest the fearful heat which the Army\nis exposed to should increase cholera and fever. Both the Prince and\nherself, the Queen can only repeat, have their minds _constantly_\noccupied with the Army, and count the days and hours between the\nmails, and it would be a relief to the Queen to hear herself directly\nfrom General Simpson from time to time when he has leisure to write.\nThe Prince wishes to be most kindly named to General Simpson, and\njoins with the Queen in every possible good wish for himself and her\nbrave and beloved troops.",

Neither the Chief of the Staff nor the Military Secretary\ncan supply that want, and the General himself must feel unequal to it\nwithout any experience on the subject, and so will his successor.\nPrince Edward told the Queen _in strict confidence_ that General\nSimpson's position in Lord Raglan's Headquarters had been anything\nbut pleasant, that the Staff had been barely civil to him; he was\ngenerally treated as an interloper, so that the Sardinian and French\nOfficers attached to our Headquarters observed upon it as a strange\nthing which would not be tolerated in their Armies, and that General\nSimpson showed himself grateful to them for the civility which they\nshowed to a General Officer of rank _aux cheveux blancs_.

I will therefore only give in a few words\nmy impressions.\nI am _delighted_, _enchanted_, _amused_, and _interested_, and think\nI never saw anything more _beautiful_ and gay than Paris--or more\nsplendid than all the Palaces. Our reception is _most_ gratifying--for\nit is enthusiastic and really kind in the highest degree; and Mar\u00e9chal\nMagnan (whom you know well) says that such a reception as I have\nreceived _every day here_ is much greater and much more enthusiastic\neven than Napoleon on his return from his victories had received! Our\nentrance into Paris was a scene which was _quite feenhaft_, and\nwhich could hardly be seen anywhere else; was quite _overpowering_--\nsplendidly decorated--illuminated--immensely\ncrowded--and 60,000 troops out--from the Gare de Strasbourg to St\nCloud, of which 20,000 Gardes Nationales, who had come great distances\nto see me.\nThe Emperor has done wonders for Paris, and for the Bois de Boulogne.\nEverything is beautifully _mont\u00e9_ at Court--_very_ quiet, and\nin excellent order; I must say we are both much struck with the\ndifference between this and the poor King's time, when the noise,\nconfusion, and bustle were great. We have been to the Exposition,\nto Versailles--which is most splendid and magnificent--to the Grand\nOp\u00e9ra, where the reception and the way in which \"God save the Queen\"\nwas sung were _most magnificent_. Yesterday we went to the Tuileries;\nin the evening _Th\u00e9\u00e2tre ici_; to-night an immense ball at the H\u00f4tel de\nVille. They have asked to call a new street, which we opened, _after\nme!_\nThe heat is very great, but the weather splendid, and though the sun\nmay be hotter, the air is certainly _lighter_ than ours--and I have no\nheadache.\nThe _Zouaves_ are on guard here, and you can't see finer men; the Cent\nGardes are splendid too.\nWe drove to look at poor Neuilly on Sunday, the Emperor and Empress\nproposing it themselves; and it was a most _melancholy sight_, all in\nruins. At _le grand Trianon_ we saw the pretty chapel in which poor\nMarie was married; at the Tuileries the Cabinet where the poor King\nsigned his fatal abdication. I wish _you_ would take an opportunity of\ntelling the poor Queen that we had thought much of her and the family\nhere, had visited those spots which were connected with them in\nparticular, and that we had greatly admired the King's great works at\nVersailles, which have been left _quite intact_. Indeed, the Emperor\n(as in everything) has shown _great_ tact and good feeling about all\nthis, and spoke without any bitterness of the King.\nI still mean to visit (and this was _his_ proposition) the Chapelle de\nSt Ferdinand, which I hope you will likewise mention to the Queen....\nThe children are so fond of the Emperor, who is so very kind to them.\nHe _is_ very _fascinating_, with that great quiet and gentleness. He\nhas certainly excellent manners, and both he and the dear and _very_\ncharming Empress (whom Albert likes particularly) do the _honneurs\nextremely_ well and _very_ gracefully, and are full of _every kind_\nattention....\nInstead of my short letter I have written you a very long one, and\nmust end. Many thanks for your kind letter of the 17th.\nHow beautiful and how enjoyable is this place! Ever your devoted\nNiece,\nVICTORIA R.",

It was touching and pleasing in the extreme to see the\nalliance sealed so completely, and without lowering _either_ Country's\npride, and to see old enmities and rivalries _wiped out_ over the tomb\nof Napoleon I., before whose coffin I stood (by torchlight) at the arm\nof Napoleon III., now my nearest and dearest ally! We have come back\nwith feelings of _real_ affection for and interest in _France_--and\nindeed how could it be otherwise when one saw _how_ much was done to\n_please_ and delight us? The Army too (such a fine one!) I feel a real\naffection for, as the companions of my beloved troops!\nFor the Emperor _personally_ I have conceived a _real_ affection and\nfriendship, and so I may truly say of the Prince. You know what _I\nfelt_ the moment I saw him and became acquainted with him, what I\nwrote down about him, etc. Well, we have now seen him for full _ten\ndays_, from twelve to fourteen hours every day--often alone; and I\ncannot say _how_ pleasant and easy it is to live with him, or how\nattached one becomes to him. I know _no_ one who puts me more at my\nease, or to whom I felt more inclined to talk unreservedly, or in whom\ninvoluntarily I should be more inclined to confide, than the Emperor!\nHe was entirely at his ease with us--spoke most openly and frankly\nwith us on all subjects--EVEN the _most_ delicate, viz. the Orleans\nFamily (this was with _me_, for I was driving alone with him), and I\nam happy to _feel_ that there is nothing now between us which could\n_mar_ our personal good _entente_ and friendly and intimate footing.\nHe is so simple, so _na\u00eff_, never making _des phrases_, or paying\ncompliments--so full of tact, good taste, high breeding; his\nattentions and respect towards us were so simple and unaffected, his\nkindness and friendship for the Prince so natural and so gratifying,\n_because_ it is _not_ forced, not _pour faire des compliments_. He\nis quite _The Emperor_, and yet in _no_ way playing it; the Court and\nwhole house infinitely more _regal_ and better managed than in poor\nLouis Philippe's time, when all was in great noise and confusion, and\nthere was _no_ Court. We parted with _mutual_ sorrow, and the Emperor\nexpressed his hope that we shall frequently meet and \"pas avec de si\ngrandes c\u00e9r\u00e9monies\"!\nWhat I write here is my feeling and conviction: wonderful it is that\nthis _man_--whom certainly we were _not_ over well-disposed to--should\nby _force_ of _circumstances_ be drawn into such close connection with\nus, and become _personally_ our friend, and _this_ entirely by his\n_own personal_ qualities, in spite of so much that _was and could_ be\nsaid against him! To the children (who behaved beautifully, and had\nthe most extraordinary success) his kindness, and judicious kindness,\nwas _great_, and they are _excessively_ fond of him. In short, without\n_attempting_ to do anything particular to _make_ one like him, or\nANY personal attraction in outward appearance, he _has_ the power\nof _attaching_ those to him who come near him and know him, which is\n_quite incredible_. He is excessively kind in private, and so very\nquiet. I shall always look back on the time passed not only in France,\nbut with _him_ personally, as _most_ agreeable. The Prince, though\nless enthusiastic than I am, I can see well, shares this feeling, and\nI think it is very reciprocal on the Emperor's part; he is very fond\nof the Prince and truly appreciates him. With respect to the War,\nnothing can be more frank and fair and honest than he is about it, but\nit makes him unhappy and anxious.\nThe dear Empress, who was all kindness and goodness, whom we are all\nvery fond of, we saw comparatively but little of, as for _really_ and\n_certainly very_ good reasons she must take great care of herself....\nVICTORIA R.",

England would thereby undertake a responsibility which\nshe is in no way capable of bearing, unless she took the Government\npermanently into her own hands. The plea on which the interference is\nto be based, viz. that the misgovernment at Naples brings Monarchical\ninstitutions into disrepute, and might place weapons in the hands of\nthe democracy (as put forth by Sir W.

Whether such an armed\ninterference in favour of the people of Naples against their\nGovernment would lead to a Revolution or not, as apprehended by the\nFrench Government and disbelieved by Lord Palmerston, must be so\nentirely a matter of chance that it would be idle to predict the\nexact consequences. If 99 out of every 100 Neapolitans, however, are\ndissatisfied with their Government (as Lord Palmerston states), it\nis not unreasonable to expect that our demonstration may give them\nconfidence enough to rise, and if beat down by the King's troops\nin presence of our ships, our position would become exceedingly\nhumiliating.\nAny insult offered to the British Government, on the other hand, it\nhas a perfect right to resent, and to ask reparation for.

The Neapolitan Government deny\nhaving intended any slight on the British Legation by the order\nrespecting the Box of the \"Intendant du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre,\" which they state to\nhave been general, and deny any intention to interfere with the free\nintercourse of the members of our Legation with Neapolitans, to which\nSir W. Temple merely replies that notwithstanding the denial such an\nintention is believed by the public to exist.\nThe case becomes therefore a very delicate one, requiring the greatest\ncare on our part not to put ourselves in the wrong.\nIt will be of the greatest importance to come to a thorough\nunderstanding with France, and if possible also with Austria, on the\nsubject.",

With respect to the draft to Lord\nStratford, instructing him to recommend to the Porte an application\nto the Austrian Government for the withdrawal or diminution of the\nAustrian troops in the Principalities, I have been commanded to write\nwhat the Queen has not time this morning to put on paper. Her Majesty\ndoes not feel that the objects of this proposed Despatch have been\nsufficiently explained. It does not appear to Her Majesty that, in\na military point of view, the plans of the Allies are sufficiently\nmatured to make it clear whether the withdrawal of the Austrian Army\nwould be an advantage or a disadvantage. If the Allies intend to\nmarch through the Principalities, and attack Russia on that side, the\npresence of the Austrians might be an inconvenience. If, on the other\nhand, they advance from the East, it is a positive advantage to have\nthe Russians contained on the other flank, by the Austrians in their\npresent position. Looking at the political bearing of this move, Her\nMajesty thinks that it will not fail to have an unfavourable effect on\nAustria, who will be hurt at the Allies urging the Porte to endeavour\nto put an end to an arrangement entered into at the suggestion, or at\nall events with the approval, of the Allies. It cannot be an object\nat this moment, when extraneous circumstances have probably acted\nfavourably for us on the minds of the Emperor of Austria and his\nGovernment, to check that disposition, make them distrust us, and\nincline them to throw themselves towards Russia, who now will spare no\nefforts to gain them. Her Majesty sees by your proposed Despatch you\ndo not expect the Austrians to comply with this demand. Even if they\nconsented to diminish the numbers of their Troops, they would do so\nonly to suit their own convenience, and such diminution would in no\nways decrease the evils of the occupation. Lastly, the Queen is of\nopinion that if such a proposal is to be made, it ought not to be done\nthrough Lord Stratford and the Porte, but that the subject should\nbe broached at Vienna and the Austrian Government asked what their\nintentions are; that this would be the more friendly, more open, and\nmore dignified course, and more likely than the other plan of being\nsuccessful. Her Majesty, however, doubts that any such demand will be\nacceded to by the Austrians, and believes that their refusal will put\nthe Allies in an awkward position.\nThis is, I believe, the pith of Her Majesty's opinions--there appears\nto me to be much sense in them--and they are well deserving of your\nand Palmerston's consideration. Yours sincerely,\nGRANVILLE.",

It would\nbe necessary, of course, to ascertain clearly that Mr Herbert's views\nabout the war and about conditions of peace are the same as they were\nwhen he was a Member of the Government, and not such as those which Mr\nGladstone and Sir James Graham have of late adopted.\nIf Mr Herbert were to accept, Sir George Grey, who has a strong\ndisinclination for the Colonies, would remain at the Home Office; and\nif Lord Harrowby would take the Post Office, which must be held by a\nPeer, the Duchy of Lancaster, which may be held by a Commoner, might\nbe offered to Mr Baines with a seat in the Cabinet, and Mr Baines\nmight perhaps, with reference to his health, prefer an office not\nattended with much departmental business of detail, while he would be\nthus more free to make himself master of general questions.

The effect of this on the French\nis very bad, and the Prince had a letter only two days ago from the\nPrince of Prussia, saying that every one was shocked at the manner in\nwhich our officers came home, and that it lowered our Army very much\nin the eyes of foreign Armies, and generally decreased the\nsympathy for our troops.

    "body": "The Queen has received Lord Clarendon's letter, and returns the very\nsatisfactory enclosures from Lord Cowley. Count Walewski remains true\nto himself; yet the admission that the Neutralisation Clause ought to\nbe part of the European treaty, and not an annex, which _he makes_, is\nthe most important concession which we could desire. That the Sea\nof Azov is to be dropped the Queen is glad of, as it would appear so\nhumiliating to Russia that Austria would probably decline proposing\nit. What the Queen is most afraid of, and what she believes actuates\nthe Emperor also, is the consideration that Austria, made aware of\nthe intense feeling for Peace _\u00e0 tout prix_ in France, might get\nfrightened at the good terms for us she meant to propose to Russia,\nand might long for an opportunity given by us, in any unreasonable\ndemand for modification, to back out of her proposal altogether. Lord\nA. Loftus in his last letter states that Baron Manteuffel even was\nafraid of having admitted as proper, terms too hard upon Russia, since\npeace is wanted at Paris.\nThe course intended to be pursued by Lord Clarendon in summing up the\nwhole question in a public Despatch seems quite the right one, as it\nwould never do, on the other hand, to let England be considered as\nmerely _\u00e0 la remorque_ of France, an impression unfortunately very\nprevalent on the Continent at this moment.\nAs to Marshal P\u00e9lissier, the best thing the Emperor could do would be\nto recall him, and to put a younger and more enterprising man in his\nplace. As we have got our hero coming home, his French colleague might\nbe recalled also.\nThe Duke of Newcastle's letter is very interesting; the Queen will\nreturn it this evening. It confirms the truth of the axiom that a\n_settled policy_ ought to precede a military plan of campaign, for\nwhich the Prince is always contending.\nWe have been much pleased with old Sir Colin Campbell, who is a\nthorough soldier, and appears not at all wanting in good sense. On\nasking him about our rising men, and the officer whom _he_ would point\nout as the one of most promise, he said that Colonel Mansfield was\nwithout comparison the man from whom great services could be expected\nboth in the Field and as an Administrator. Lord Clarendon will be\npleased to hear this, but will also not be surprised if the Queen\nshould look out for an opportunity to reclaim him for the Army from\nthe Foreign Office.",

If\nFrance agreed to this, we might agree to the rest of the arrangement.\nGeneral P\u00e9lissier's plan has the advantage of setting us free, but\ndeprives us of the Sardinians in the field, an object the French\nhave kept steadily in view.

He leaves us to-morrow at an extraordinary hour--four\no'clock in the morning (which you did once or twice)--wishing to be at\nCompi\u00e8gne to-morrow night, and at Turin on Tuesday. He is _eine ganz\nbesondere, abenteuerliche Erscheinung_, startling in the extreme in\nappearance and manner when you _first_ see him, but, just as Aumale\nsays, _il faut l'aimer quand on le conna\u00eet bien_. He is so frank,\nopen, just, straightforward, liberal and tolerant, with much sound\ngood sense. He never breaks his word, and you may rely on him, but\nwild and extravagant, courting adventures and dangers, and with a very\nstrange, short, rough manner, an exaggeration of that short manner of\nspeaking which his poor brother had. He is shy in society, which makes\nhim still more brusque, and he does not know (never having been out of\nhis own country or even out in Society) what to say to the number\nof people who are presented to him here, and which is, I know from\nexperience, a most odious thing. He is truly attached to the Orleans\nfamily, particularly to Aumale, and will be a friend and adviser to\nthem. To-day he will be invested with the Order of the Garter. He is\nmore like a Knight or King of the Middle Ages than anything one knows\nnowadays.\nOn Monday we go to Osborne till the 21st.\nOne word about Vicky. I must say that she has a quick discernment of\ncharacter, and I have never seen her take _any_ predilection for a\nperson which was _not motiv\u00e9_ by personal amiability, goodness, or\ndistinction of some kind or other. You need be under no apprehension\nwhatever on this subject; and she has, moreover, great tact and\n_esprit de conduite_. It is quite extraordinary how popular she is in\nSociety--and again now, all these Foreigners are so struck with her\nsense and _conversation_ for her age.\nHoping soon to hear from you again, and wishing that naughty Stockmar\nmay yet be brought to come, believe me ever your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

    "body": "Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\nconcludes that Lord Lansdowne informed your Majesty that the Cabinet,\nafter hearing from Lord Clarendon a statement of the course of\nthe recent negotiations as explained by the despatches which Lord\nClarendon read, came to the decision that no further step should be\ntaken, and no further communication should be made to the Government\nof France on the matters at issue, until the final decision of the\nRussian Government on the pure and simple adoption of the Austrian\nultimatum should be known. Viscount Palmerston begs to congratulate\nyour Majesty upon the telegraphic message received this morning from\nSir Hamilton Seymour, announcing that the Russian Government has\nadopted that Austrian ultimatum. So far so well, and the success which\nhas attended firmness and steadiness of purpose in regard to those\nconditions may be looked upon as a tolerably sure indication that a\nperseverance in the same course will bring the Russian Government to\nconsent to those remaining conditions which the Austrian Government\nhas not yet (as it says) made known to the Cabinet of Petersburg.\nWith regard to the letter of the Emperor of the French to your\nMajesty, and the statements made to Lord Clarendon by the Count de\nPersigny as to the difficulties of the Emperor's internal position\nwith respect to finance, and a general desire for peace throughout\nthe Nation, Viscount Palmerston expressed his opinion to the Cabinet\nyesterday that all those representations were greatly exaggerated. He\nis convinced that the Emperor of the French is perfectly master of his\nown position, and that he can as to peace or war take the course which\nhe may determine to adopt.\nThe cabal of stock-jobbing politicians, by whom he is surrounded,\n_must_ give way to him if he is firm. They have no standing place in\nthe confidence and respect of their fellow-countrymen, they represent\nnothing but the Stock Exchange speculations in which they are engaged,\nand the Emperor's throne would probably be stronger, rather than\nweaker, if they were swept away, and better men put in their places.\nAnd it is a very remarkable circumstance that at the very moment when\nyour Majesty and your Majesty's Government were being told that\nthe Emperor would be unable to go on with the war on account of the\ndifficulty of finding money, the French Government was putting forth\nin the _Moniteur_ an official statement showing that they have a\nreserve surplus of twenty-one millions sterling for defraying the\nexpenses of a campaign in the ensuing spring, without the necessity of\nraising any fresh loan.\nViscount Palmerston fully concurs in the sentiment of regret expressed\nby your Majesty to Lord Clarendon that the last action of the war in\nwhich your Majesty's troops have been engaged, should, if peace be now\nconcluded, have been the repulse at the Redan; but however it may suit\nnational jealousy, which will always be found to exist on the other\nside of the Channel, to dwell upon that check, yet your Majesty may\nrely upon it that the Alma and Inkerman have left recollections which\nwill dwell in the memory of the living and not be forgotten in the\npage of history; and although it would no doubt have been gratifying\nto your Majesty and to the Nation that another summer should have\nwitnessed the destruction of Cronstadt by your Majesty's gallant Navy,\nand the expulsion of the Russians from the countries south of the\nCaucasus by your Majesty's brave Army, yet if peace _can_ now be\nconcluded on conditions honourable and secure, it would, as your\nMajesty justly observes, not be right to continue the war for the\nmere purpose of prospective victories. It will, however, be obviously\nnecessary to continue active preparations for war up to the moment\nwhen a definite Treaty of Peace is signed, in order that the Russians\nmay not find it for their interest to break off negotiations when the\nseason for operations shall approach, emboldened by any relaxation\non the part of the Allies induced by too ready confidence in the good\nfaith of their adversary....",

I have given all the messages and carried out all the\ninstructions as contained in your letters, and I trust as far as\npossible I have been enabled to do some good. On the other hand, I\ncannot deny that the feelings universally expressed here as to the\nprospects of a speedy peace are so different from those felt in\nEngland, that it is extremely difficult to produce any impression in\nthe sense that we could wish it. France wishes for peace more than\nanything else on earth, and this feeling does not confine itself\nto Walewski or the Ministers--it extends itself to all classes. The\nEmperor alone is reasonable and sensible in this respect, but his\nposition is a most painful one, and he feels it very much. The fact\nis that public opinion is much more felt and more loudly expressed\nin this country than anybody in England at all imagines. No doubt the\nEmperor can do much that he wishes, but still he cannot go altogether\nagainst a feeling which so loudly expresses itself on all occasions,\nwithout thereby injuring his own position most seriously. I have\nwritten to Clarendon very fully on this subject, and have explained to\nhim my reasons for wishing to return to England as soon as possible,\nnow that our military mission is concluded. It is essential that\nI should see the members of the Government, and that I should\ncommunicate to them the exact state of feeling here and the views of\nthe Emperor as to the mode of smoothing down all difficulties. This\ncan only be done by a personal interview on the part of somebody\nthoroughly aware of the present position of affairs. Probably at this\nmoment I am in a better position to do this than anybody else, from\nthe peculiar circumstances in which I have been placed while here, and\nit is this feeling which makes me desirous to return to England with\nthe least possible delay. It is my intention therefore to start\nwith my colleagues to-morrow, Monday night, for England, to which\narrangement the Emperor has given his sanction, and by which time he\nwill be prepared to tell me what he thinks had best be done, from his\nview of the question. I think it my duty to communicate this to you,\nand hope that you will give my resolution your sanction. I beg to\nremain, my dear Cousin, your most dutiful Cousin,\nGEORGE.",

The Duke seems to have\nanswered as we could wish, and the Queen pretended _never_ to have\n_heard_ the report, merely saying that as the proposed ultimatum\nwas then much talked of, it was very possible the King might\nunintentionally have mistaken the observations of the Ministers and\nourselves as to our being _unable_ to _agree_, without great caution,\nto what appeared to be _agreed_ on beforehand between _France_ and\n_Austria_, and possibly _might_ have in his blunt way stated something\nwhich alarmed the Emperor--but that she could not imagine it could be\nanything else. There seems, however, really no _end_ to _cancans_ at\n_Paris_; for the Duke of Cambridge seems to have shared the same fate.\nThe two atmospheres of France and England, as well as the Society, are\nso different that people get to talk differently.

    "body": "The Governor-General presents his most humble duty to your Majesty,\nand has the honour of submitting to your Majesty a copy of a\nProclamation, whereby the Kingdom of Oudh has been placed exclusively\nand permanently under the authority of your Majesty's Government.\nThe various considerations, and the course of public events, which\nled to this necessity, have long since been laid before your Majesty's\nGovernment in great detail.\nThe Governor-General during the past summer communicated to the Home\nAuthorities his readiness to remain in India as long as he dared,\nnamely, for one additional month, until the 1st of March, for the\npurpose of carrying into effect the proposed policy regarding Oudh--if\nit was desired that he should do so.\nThe orders from the Home Government reached the Governor-General only\nupon the 2nd of January, leaving barely two months for the assembling\nof the military force which was necessary to provide against all\nrisks--for the negotiations with the King--and for the organisation of\nthe future Civil and Military Administration of Oudh.\nEvery preparation having been completed, the Resident at Lucknow\nwaited upon the King in person--communicated to him the resolution\nwhich the British Government had taken--and tendered for his\nacceptance a new Treaty, whereby the transfer of the Government of\nOudh would have been made a matter of amicable agreement.\nThe King wholly refused to sign any Treaty. He declared himself ready\nto submit to the will of the British Government in all things. He bade\nthe Resident observe that every mark of power had already been laid\ndown by His Majesty's own orders--the guns at the palace gates were\ndismounted, the guards bore no arms, and, though drawn up as usual in\nthe Court, they saluted the Resident with their hands only; while not\na weapon was worn by any officer in the Palace.\nThe King gave way to passionate bursts of grief and anger--implored\nthe intercession of the Resident in his behalf--and finally,\nuncovering his head, he placed his turban in the Resident's hands.\nThis act--the deepest mark of humiliation and helplessness which a\nnative of the East can exhibit--became doubly touching and significant\nwhen the head thus bared in supplication was one that had worn a royal\ncrown.\nThe Government, however, had already borne too long with the wrongs\ninflicted by the sovereigns of Oudh upon their unhappy subjects. The\nclamorous grief of the King could not be allowed to shut out the cry\nof his people's misery. The King's appeal, therefore, could not be\nlistened to; and as His Majesty, at the end of the three days' space\nwhich was allowed him for deliberation, still resolutely refused to\nsign a Treaty, the territory of Oudh was taken possession of, by the\nissue of the Proclamation which has now been respectfully submitted to\nyour Majesty.\nIt is the fourth kingdom in India which has passed under your\nMajesty's sceptre during the last eight years.\nPerfect tranquillity has prevailed in Oudh since the event which\nhas just been narrated. General Outram writes that the populace of\nLucknow, more interested than any other community in the maintenance\nof the native dynasty, already \"appear to have forgotten they ever had\na King.\" In the districts the Proclamation has been heartily welcomed\nby the middle and lower classes; while even the higher orders, who of\ncourse lose much in a native state by the cessation of corruption and\ntyranny, have shown no symptoms of dissatisfaction.\nThere seems every reason to hope and expect that the same complete\ntranquillity will attend the further progress of our arrangements for\nthe future administration of Oudh....\nThe Governor-General has only further to report to your Majesty that\nLord Canning arrived at Madras on the 14th inst., and that he will\nassume the Government of India on the last day of this month.\nThe Governor-General will report hereafter Lord Canning's arrival at\nFort William; and he has now the honour to subscribe himself, your\nMajesty's most obedient, most humble and devoted Subject and Servant,\nDALHOUSIE.",

She\nfeels certain that the bad accounts of the French Army in the Crimea,\nwhich appears to suffer _now_ all the misery which ours suffered last\nyear at the worst time of the siege, will more than ever indispose the\nEmperor from risking a renewal of hostilities. It is affirmed that the\nFrench have beyond 20,000 men in hospital!\nIf we are to have this peace, however, the Queen must again agree with\nLord Clarendon that we ought not _ourselves_ to depreciate it, as our\nPress has done the deeds of our Army.\nWith regard to the principalities, it is the Queen's opinion that\nnothing will oppose a barrier to Russia and her intrigues but\nthe arrangement which will satisfy the people themselves, viz. an\n_hereditary monarchy_. The example of Egypt might perfectly well be\nfollowed in Wallachia and Moldavia.\nThe subject of Poland would, in the Queen's opinion, be much better\nleft unintroduced into the present negotiations; we have no claim\narising out of this war to ask Russia to make concessions on that\nhead, which, moreover, would be treated by her as an internal question\nnot admitting of foreign interference.\nThe clause in the Treaty of Vienna about the Bonapartes is a dead\nletter, as this very Treaty, now to be signed, will prove, and the\nEmperor would act very unwisely to call for an alteration in which all\nPowers who signed the original Treaty would claim to be consulted. We\nhave every interest not to bring about a European Congress _pour la\nR\u00e9vision des Trait\u00e9s_, which many people suspect the Emperor wishes to\nturn the present Conference into.\nThe Queen wishes only to add that, should Prussia be asked to join in\nthe final Treaty on the ground of her having been a party to the July\nTreaty, we should take care that it does not appear that this was\nan act of courtesy of all the other Powers towards Prussia except\nEngland, who need not be made to take additional unpopularity in\nGermany upon herself.",

    "body": "It is a strange omission in our Constitution that while _the wife_\nof a _King_ has the highest rank and dignity in the realm after her\nhusband assigned to her by law, the _husband_ of a _Queen regnant_\nis entirely ignored by the law. This is the more extraordinary, as\na husband has in this country such particular rights and such great\npower over his wife, and as the Queen is married just as any other\nwoman is, and swears to obey her lord and master, as such, while by\nlaw he has no rank or defined position. This is a strange anomaly.\nNo doubt, as is the case _now_--the Queen _can_ give her husband the\nhighest _place_ by _placing_ him _always near her person_, and the\nNation would give it him as a _matter of course_. Still, when I first\nmarried, we had much difficulty on this subject; much bad feeling was\nshown, and several members of the Royal Family showed bad grace\nin giving precedence to the Prince, and the late King of Hanover\npositively resisted doing so. I gave the Prince precedence by issuing\nLetters Patent, but these give no rank in Parliament--or at the\nCouncil Board--and it would be far better to put this question beyond\nall doubt, and to secure its settlement for _all future Consorts of\nQueens_, and thus have this omission in the Constitution rectified.\nNaturally my own feeling would be to give the Prince the same title\nand rank as I have, but a Titular King is a complete novelty in\nthis country, and might be productive of more inconveniences than\nadvantages to the individual who bears it. Therefore, upon mature\nreflection, and after considering the question for nearly _sixteen\nyears_, I have come to the conclusion that the title which is now by\nuniversal consent given him of \"Prince Consort,\" with the highest rank\nin and out of Parliament immediately after the Queen, and before every\nother Prince of the Royal Family, should be the one assigned to the\nhusband of the Queen regnant _once and for all_. This ought to be done\nbefore our children grow up, and it seems peculiarly easy to do so\n_now_ that none of the old branches of the Royal Family are still\nalive.\nThe present position is this: that while every British subject, down\nto the Knight, Bachelor, Doctor, and Esquire, has a rank and position\nby _Law_, the Queen's husband alone has one by _favour_--and by his\nwife's favour, who may grant it or not! When granted as in the present\ncase, it does not extend to Parliament and the Council, and the\nchildren may deny the position which their mother has given to their\nfather as a usurpation over them, having the law on their side; or if\nthey waive their rights in his favour, he will hold a position granted\nby the forbearance of his children. In both cases this is a position\nmost derogatory to the Queen as well as to her husband, and most\ndangerous to the peace and well-being of her family. If the children\nresist, the Queen will have her husband pushed away from her side by\nher children, and they will take precedence over the man whom she is\nbound to obey; if they are dutiful, she will owe her peace of mind to\ntheir continued generosity.\nWith relation to Foreign Courts, the Queen's position is equally\nhumiliating in this respect. _Some_ Sovereigns (crowned heads) address\nher husband as \"Brother,\" some as \"Brother and Cousin,\" some merely as\n\"Cousin.\" When the Queen has been abroad, her husband's position has\nalways been a subject of negotiation and vexation; the position which\nhas been accorded to him the Queen has always had to acknowledge as\na grace and favour bestowed on her by the Sovereign whom she visited.\nWhile last year the Emperor of the French treated the Prince as a\nRoyal personage, his uncle declined to come to Paris avowedly because\nhe would not give precedence to the Prince; and on the Rhine in 1845\nthe King of Prussia could not give the place to the Queen's husband\nwhich common civility required, because of the presence of an\nArchduke, the third son of an uncle of the then reigning Emperor of\nAustria, who would not give the _pas_, and whom the King would not\noffend.\nThe only legal position in Europe, according to international law,\nwhich the husband of the Queen of England enjoys, is that of a younger\nbrother of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, and this merely because the\nEnglish law does not know of him. This is derogatory to the dignity of\nthe Crown of England.\nBut _nationally_ also it is an injury to the position of the Crown\nthat the Queen's husband should have no other title than that of\nPrince of Saxe-Coburg, and thus be perpetually represented to the\ncountry as a foreigner. \"The Queen and her foreign husband, the Prince\nAlbert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha!\"\nThe Queen has a right to claim that her husband should be an\nEnglishman, bearing an English title, and enjoying a legal position\nwhich she has not to defend with a wife's anxiety as a usurpation\nagainst her own children, her subjects, and Foreign Courts.\nThe question has often been discussed by me with different Prime\nMinisters and Lord Chancellors, who have invariably entirely agreed\nwith me; but the wish to wait for a good moment to bring the matter\nbefore Parliament has caused one year after another to elapse without\nanything being done. If I become _now_ more anxious to have it\nsettled, it is in order that it should be so before our children are\ngrown up, that it might not appear to be done in order to guard their\nfather's position against them personally, which could not fail to\nproduce a painful impression upon their minds.\nIf properly explained to Parliament and the country, I cannot foresee\nthe slightest difficulty in getting such a necessary measure passed,\nparticularly if it be made quite clear to the House of Commons that it\nis in no way connected with a desire to obtain an increased grant for\nthe Prince.\nVICTORIA R.",

These Princes have very\nlarge _suites_, and I should therefore in such a case be totally\nunable to lodge you and _them_. But there is another reason. While\nFritz Wilhelm is here, _every_ spare moment Vicky has (and _I_ have,\nfor I must chaperon this loving couple--which takes away so much of my\nprecious time) is devoted to her bridegroom, who is _so_ much in\nlove, that, even if he is out driving and walking with her, he is not\nsatisfied, and says he has not seen her, unless he can have her for an\nhour to himself, when I am naturally bound to be acting as chaperon.\nUnder these circumstances I may truly say that dear Charlotte would\nhave very little enjoyment; she would see very little of Vicky, _I\ncould not_ take care of her, and I fear it would be anything but\nagreeable for her. Fritz Wilhelm would besides be miserable if I took\nVicky more away from him than I already do, and therefore _while he_\nis here, it would _not_, I think, be advisable that _Charlotte_ should\ncome.

    "body": "With Mr Labouchere's humble duty to Her Majesty. Mr Labouchere begs to\nsubmit the following observations in reply to Her Majesty's enquiries\nrespecting the Free States in the vicinity of the British Colonies in\nSouth Africa.\nThere are two independent States there:--\n(1.) The Transvaal Republic, founded by Boers who left the Colony for\nthe most part from ten to fifteen years ago. The territory on which\nthey are established never was British. The Government of the day,\nthinking it useless and impolitic to pursue them there, entered into\na capitulation with them and recognised their independent existence.\nThey inhabit the plains north of the Vaal or Yellow River.\n(2.) The Orange River Free State. This occupies the territory between\nthe Vaal River to the north and the Orange River to the south. This\nterritory, like the former, was occupied originally by emigrant Boers,\nand was beyond the boundaries of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope.\nBut Sir Harry Smith, in 1849, after a severe military struggle with\nthe Boers, thought proper without authority from home to annex it to\nBritish Dominion. This annexation was ratified by Lord Grey,\nand the country remained for three or four years under British rule.\nAfterwards it was resolved to abandon it, during the administration\nof the Duke of Newcastle, as a result of the general revision of our\naffairs which took place at the conclusion of the Kaffir War. The\nOrange River Territory was recognised as a separate Republic in 1854.\nIt is certainly true that the existence of these Free States may\ncomplicate our relations with the Kaffirs, and possibly be a source\nof danger to the security of British dominion in South Africa. But the\nlatter danger seems very remote. They possess _no_ portion of the\nsea coast, and are altogether a pastoral people, and are engaged in a\nconstant struggle with the barbarous tribes in their neighbourhood.\nTo retain and protect these territories would have involved an immense\nexpenditure, and been attended with great difficulties. Besides, the\nsame question would have speedily recurred, as these emigrant Boers\nwould have soon gone further into the interior, and again have\nasserted their independence. Our present relations with both these\nStates are very amicable. When Governor Sir George Grey went to the\nCape all these questions had been finally disposed of.\nThere seems to be good reason to hope that the apprehensions of a\nKaffir War will not be realised. The Colony is very prosperous, and\nis beginning to export wool in large quantities. The new legislature\nappears to be disposed to act harmoniously with the Governor, and to\nbe actuated by a spirit of loyalty and attachment to this country.\nWhat they most want is a supply of European settlers, which it is to\nbe hoped that the soldiers of the German and Swiss Legions will give\nthem.",

    "body": "Lord Granville presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs,\naccording to your Majesty's desire, to submit to your Majesty the\nimpressions which he has received during the short time of his stay in\nthis country.\nLord Granville's conversation with the Emperor of Russia, and what he\nhas heard from various reliable sources, have led him to the following\nconclusions respecting His Imperial Majesty.\nHe is handsome, but thinner and graver than when he was in England.\nWhen speaking with energy to Lord Granville his manner seemed to be\nrather an imitation of some one else than his own, and he did not look\nLord Granville in the face. His usual manner is singularly gentle and\npleasing. He does not give the idea of having much strength either of\nintellect or of character, but looks intelligent and amiable.\nAlthough the education of a C\u00e6sarwitch must be subject to pernicious\ninfluences, the present Emperor has had advantages which those in his\nposition have not usually had. The Emperor Nicholas came to the throne\nwithout having had the confidences of his predecessor. He initiated\nhis son into everything that was going on, while others who knew the\ngood-nature of the Grand Duke Alexander's character, told him that\nwhich they did not tell his father. He was supposed to have different\ntastes from the late Emperor, but, since the death of the latter, he\nhas liked the late Emperor's favourite residence which he himself had\nformerly disliked, he has taken to all the military pursuits of\nhis father, and is said to have shown undignified haste in issuing\nregulations about, and in appearing in, new uniforms. He is liked by\nthose who surround him, but is blamed for not having those habits of\npunctuality and of quick decision in business which characterised the\nlate Emperor.\nThere is still much talk of stimulants to be applied by His Imperial\nMajesty to commerce and to the development of the resources of the\ncountry.... There are persons, however, here well qualified to judge,\nwho doubt whether much more will be performed than has formerly\nbeen done, after brilliant promises at the beginning of a reign. His\nImperial Majesty is not supposed to have that power of will which will\nenable him to deal with the mass of corruption which pervades every\nclass in this country. The Empress, a woman of sense and ability,\nis believed to have great influence with her husband when he is with\nher, but he is generally guided by the person who speaks last to\nhim before he acts--and His Imperial Majesty has not the talent of\nsurrounding himself with able men. His Ministers certainly do not\nappear to be men of that remarkable intellect as have been usually\nsupposed to be employed by the Court of St Petersburg. Count Orloff\nis stated to have but little influence, and to have lost his\nformer activity. Prince Gortschakoff is clever in society, of easy\nconversation and some smartness in repartee. He is vain, a great\ntalker, and indiscreet. It is difficult to keep him to the point. He\nflies about from one thing to another, and he is so loose in his talk,\nthat the repetition of isolated phrases might lead to impressions of\nhis meaning, which would not be correct....\nThe Serf Question is admitted by all to be of a very difficult\ncharacter, and will become more so as the wealth of the country\nincreases. Indeed when that state of things occurs, it is more than\nlikely that popular movements will take place, and it is frightful to\nconsider the immediate results of a revolution in a country organised\nas this is at present. No country in Europe will furnish so fair a\nchance of success to Socialism. The reins of Government were held so\ntight during the last reign, that even the relaxation which now exists\nis not altogether without danger.\nThe preparations for the Coronation are on an immense scale. The\npresent estimate of the expenses is \u00a31,000,000; the last Coronation\ncost half that sum; the Coronation of Alexander, \u00a3150,000; while that\nof the Emperor Paul did not exceed \u00a350,000. The military household of\nthe present Emperor consists of one hundred and twenty generals--that\nof Nicholas, at the beginning of his reign, consisted of twenty.\nYour Majesty is spoken of by the Emperor and by the Society here with\nthe greatest respect. Lord and Lady Granville have met with nothing\nbut remarkable civility from all classes.\nLord Granville has had great pleasure in seeing His Royal Highness\nPrince Frederick William of Prussia in such good health and spirits.\nHis only anxiety was an interval of fourteen days during which His\nRoyal Highness did not hear from England. That anxiety has been\nrelieved by a letter received to-day. Lord Granville ventures to\nrequest your Majesty to present his respectful remembrances to the\nPrincess Royal with his congratulations at Her Royal Highness's\ncomplete recovery. Lord Granville begs to advise Her Royal Highness,\nwhen residing abroad, not to engage a Russian maid. Lady Wodehouse\nfound hers eating the contents of a pot on her dressing-table--it\nhappened to be castor oil pomatum for the hair.\nLord Granville has been requested to convey to your Majesty and to\nHis Royal Highness Prince Albert the Prince of Nassau's expressions of\ndevotion and respect. The atmosphere in which His Highness at present\nresides does not appear to have had much influence on His Highness's\nopinions.",

My object is and was that Charlotte should decide as _she_\nlikes it, and uninfluenced by what I might prefer. _I_ should _prefer_\nPedro, that I confess, but the Archduke has made a favourable\nimpression on Charlotte; I saw that long before any question of\nengagement had taken place. The Archduke is out at sea, and nothing\ncan well be heard before the 25th of this month.

There should exist a\nwell-considered general scheme for each place supported by a detailed\nargument; this when approved by the Government, should be sanctioned\nand signed by the Sovereign, and not deviated from except upon\nresubmission and full explanation of the causes which render such\ndeviation necessary; no special work should be undertaken which does\nnot realise part of this general scheme. The Queen trusts that Lord\nPanmure will succeed in effecting this.\nIt is very much to be regretted that so few of the soldiers of\nthe German Legion should have accepted the liberal terms of the\nGovernment.

Before sanctioning it, she thinks it right to ask\nfor an explanation of the services of the officers, and the reasons\nfor which they are selected for the honour. She returns the list for\nthat purpose to Lord Panmure, who will perhaps cause the statement\nto be attached to each name. This, of course, does not apply to the\nforeigners.

We want a Director-General of Education very much, but\nhe ought to be immediately under the Commander-in-Chief, if possible\na General Officer of weight, assisted by a Board of Officers of the\ndifferent Arms.\nEducation ought to be made one of the essential requisites of an\nofficer, and the reports on his proficiency ought to go direct through\nthe proper superior from the bottom to the top, particularly if\nselection by merit is to receive a greater application for the future.\nIf for his military proficiency and moral discipline, an officer is to\nbe responsible to his Military chief, but for his mental acquirements\nto a Civil department, the unity of the system will be broken and the\nArmy ruined; and this _must_ be the case if the superintendence of the\neducation is separated from the Military command.\nThe subject of Military Education has, as Lord Palmerston says, often\nbeen discussed in Parliament, which expects that some sufficient\narrangement shall be made for it. But the mere creation of a place\nfor an officer, however meritorious, to find him an equivalent for one\nwhich has to be reduced, can hardly be so called, and may even defeat\nthe object itself. This subject is a most important one, and ought to\nbe thoroughly examined before acting. The Queen understands that the\nDuke of Cambridge has transmitted to Lord Panmure a complete scheme,\nwhich must be now before him. If Lord Palmerston, Lord Panmure,\nthe Duke of Cambridge, and the Prince were to meet to consider this\nscheme, and the whole question in connection with it, the Queen would\nfeel every confidence that a satisfactory decision would be arrived\nat.",

He is, however, at present on crutches,\nand can hardly expect to be in marching order for some few days to\ncome. With regard to the matters that are likely to be discussed when\nParliament meets, Viscount Palmerston would beg to submit that the one\nwhich has for some months past occupied the attention of all Europe,\nnamely, the execution of the Treaty of Paris, has been settled in\na manner satisfactory to all parties; and this is not only a great\nrelief to the Government, but is also a security for the continuance\nof the Anglo-French Alliance, which would have been greatly endangered\nby the discussions and explanations that might otherwise have been\nforced on.\nThe various questions of difference between your Majesty's Government,\nand that of the United States, have also been settled, and the\ndiplomatic relations between the two countries are about to be\nreplaced upon their usual footing. This result will have given great\nsatisfaction to the commercial and manufacturing interests.\nSome discussion will take place as to the Expedition to the coast of\nPersia, and some persons will, of course, find fault with the whole\npolicy pursued on that matter; but people in general will understand\nthat Herat is an advanced post of attack against British India,\nand that whatever belongs nominally to Persia must be considered as\nbelonging practically to Russia, whenever Russia may want to use it\nfor her own purposes.\nThe outbreak of hostilities at Canton was the result of the\ndecision of your Majesty's officers on the spot, and not the\nconsequence of orders from home. The first responsibility must\ntherefore rest with the local authorities, but Viscount Palmerston\ncannot doubt that the Government will be deemed to have acted right\nin advising your Majesty to approve the proceedings, and to direct\nmeasures for obtaining from the Chinese Government concessions which\nare indispensable for the maintenance of friendly relations between\nChina and the Governments of Europe.\nOf domestic questions, that which will probably be the most agitated\nwill be a large and immediate diminution of the Income Tax; but\nany such diminution would disturb the financial arrangements of the\ncountry, and it is to be hoped that Parliament will adopt the scheme\nwhich will be proposed by Sir G. C. Lewis, by which the Income Tax\nwould be made equal in each of the next three years, the amount now\nfixed by Law for 1857 being diminished, but the amount now fixed by\nLaw for 1858 and 1859 being increased....\nViscount Palmerston hears from persons likely to know, that the\nConservative Party are not more united than they were last Session.\nThat Mr Disraeli and the great bulk of his nominal followers are far\nfrom being on good terms together, and that there is no immediate\njunction to be expected between Mr Disraeli and Mr Gladstone.\nMr Cobden has given it to be understood that he wishes at the next\nGeneral Election to retire from the West Riding of Yorkshire. The real\nfact being that the line he took about the late war has made him so\nunpopular with his constituents that he would probably not be returned\nagain.\nViscount Palmerston has heard privately and confidentially that Lord\nJohn Russell wrote some little time ago to the Duke of Bedford to say\nthat it had been intimated to him that an offer would be made to him\nif he were disposed to accept it, to go to the House of Lords and to\nbecome there the Leader of the Government. In case your Majesty may\nhave heard this report, Viscount Palmerston thinks it right to say\nthat no such communication to Lord John Russell was ever authorised\nby him, nor has been, so far as he is aware, ever made, and in truth\nViscount Palmerston must candidly say that in the present state\nof public opinion about the course which Lord John has on several\noccasions pursued, he is not inclined to think that his accession to\nthe Government would give the Government any additional strength.",

Whether the state\nof business as connected with votes of supply and the Mutiny Act would\nadmit of a Dissolution, supposing such a measure to be sanctioned\nby your Majesty, would remain to be enquired into; but Viscount\nPalmerston believes that there would be no insurmountable difficulty\non that score.

France was the only country in\nEurope that could do England harm, and on the other hand England was\nthe only country that could injure France--the late war with Russia\nhad not the slightest effect upon France except costing her money, but\na war with England would set every party in France into activity each\nwith its own peculiar objects, but all of them against the existing\norder of things--_l'ordre social serait boulevers\u00e9_ and the Empire\nmight perish in the convulsion.\nThe result of this and other conversations appears to be an earnest\ndesire of the Emperor to come to England on a private visit to\nthe Queen, if possible at Osborne, and at any time that might be\nconvenient to Her Majesty. M. de Persigny describes him as being\nintent upon this project, and as attaching the utmost importance to\nit in order to _\u00e9clairer_ his own ideas, to guide his policy, and to\nprevent by personal communication with the Queen, your Royal Highness,\nand Her Majesty's Government the dissidences and _m\u00e9sintelligences_\nwhich the Emperor thinks will arise from the want of such\ncommunications.\nI fear that such a visit would not be very agreeable to Her Majesty,\nbut in the Emperor's present frame of mind, and his evident alarm lest\nit should be thought that the Alliance has been in any way _\u00e9branl\u00e9e_,\nI cannot entertain a doubt that much good might be done, or, at all\nevents, that much mischief might be averted by the Emperor being\nallowed to pay his respects to Her Majesty in the manner he proposes.\nI have discussed the matter after the Cabinet this evening with Lord\nPalmerston, who takes entirely the same view of the matter as I have\ntaken the liberty of expressing to your Royal Highness.

I cannot say how much we like the Archduke;\nhe is charming, so clever, natural, kind and amiable, so _English_ in\nhis feelings and likings, and so anxious for the best understanding\nbetween Austria and England. With the exception of his mouth and chin,\nhe is good-looking; and I think one does not the least care for that,\nas he is so very kind and clever and pleasant. I wish you really joy,\ndearest Uncle, at having got _such_ a husband for dear Charlotte, as\nI am sure he will make her happy, and is quite worthy of her.

The bulk of the European\nforce is stationed on the North-West Frontier, and is, therefore,\nwithin comparatively easy reach of Delhi, and about six thousand\nEuropean troops will have returned to Bombay from Persia. It will,\nhowever, seem to be advisable to send off at once the force amounting\nto nearly eight thousand men, now under orders for embarkation for\nIndia; and when the despatches arrive, which will be about the middle\nof next week, it will be seen whether any further reinforcements will\nbe required.\nThe extent of the Mutiny appears to indicate some deeper cause than\nthat which was ascribed to the first insubordination.

This was the state of things on the 13th and 14th of June,\nthe latest day of which any certain accounts have been received from\nDelhi; but nothing was likely to interfere with the completion of the\ncapture within forty-eight hours.\nThis event has been long and anxiously awaited, and the time which has\nelapsed has cost England and India very dear. Many precious lives have\nbeen lost, and much heartrending suffering has been endured, for which\nthere can be no compensation. The reputation of England's power, too,\nhas had a rude shake; and nothing but a long-continued manifestation\nof her might before the eyes of the whole Indian Empire, evinced by\nthe presence of such an English force as shall make the thought of\noppositon hopeless, will re-establish confidence in her strength.\nLord Canning much fears that there are parts of India where, until\nthis is done, a complete return to peace and order will not be\neffected. Wherever the little band of English soldiers--little\nwhen compared with the stretch of country over which they have to\noperate--which Lord Canning has at his disposal has shown itself, the\neffect has been instantaneous.\nExcept at Delhi, there has scarcely been an attempt at resistance to\nan European soldier, and the march of the smallest detachments has\npreserved order right and left of the roads. The same has been the\ncase in large cities, such as Benares, Patna, and others; all going to\nprove that little more than the presence of English troops is needed\nto ensure peace. On the other hand, where such troops are known not to\nbe within reach, anarchy and violence, when once let loose, continue\nunrestrained; and, until further additions are made to the English\nregiments in the disturbed districts, this state of things will not\nonly continue, but extend itself. The fall of Delhi will act to\nsome degree as a check; but where rapine and outrage have raged\nuncontrolled, even for a few hours, it is to be feared that nothing\nbut the actual presence of force will bring the country into order.\nLord Canning rejoices to say that to-day the first Regiment of your\nMajesty's Forces destined for China has entered the Hooghly. Lord\nCanning did not scruple, knowing how much was at stake, earnestly to\npress Lord Elgin to allow those forces to be turned aside to India\nbefore proceeding to the support of your Majesty's Plenipotentiary\nin China; and to this, so far as regards the first two Regiments,\nLord Elgin readily assented. From what Lord Canning has ventured to\nstate above, your Majesty will easily understand the satisfaction with\nwhich each new arrival of an English transport in Calcutta is regarded\nby him.\nAs yet no military operations south of Delhi have been undertaken.\nNext week, however, a column composed of your Majesty's 64th and\n78th (Highland) Regiments will reach Cawnpore and Lucknow, in the\nneighbourhood of which it is probable that an opportunity will offer\nof striking a decisive blow at the band of rebels which, after that\nin Delhi, is the strongest and most compact. But Lord Canning greatly\ndoubts whether they will await the onset. Unfortunately, they may run\naway from the English troops, and yet prove very formidable to any who\nare weaker than themselves--whether Indians or unarmed Europeans.\nYour Majesty is aware that in the critical condition of affairs which\nnow exists, Lord Canning has felt himself compelled to adopt the\nmeasure of placing the King of Oudh in confinement in Fort William,\nin consequence of the use made of his name by those who have been busy\ntampering with the Sepoys; and of the intrigues which there is good\nreason to believe that the Minister of the King, who is also in the\nFort, has carried on in his master's name. The King has been, and\nwill continue to be, treated with every mark of respect and indulgence\nwhich is compatible with his position, so long as it may be necessary\nthat he should be retained in the Fort.\nLord Canning earnestly hopes that your Majesty and the Prince are in\nthe enjoyment of good health, and prays your Majesty to be graciously\npleased to accept the expression of his sincere devotion and dutiful\nattachment.",

His Motion was ostensibly for\ntwo papers, one of which does not exist, at least in the possession of\nthe Government, and the other of which ought not to be made public,\nas it relates to the arrangements for defending India against external\nattack. He represented the disturbances in India as a national revolt,\nand not as a mere military mutiny; and he enumerated various causes\nwhich in his opinion accounted, for and justified this general revolt.\nSome of these causes were various measures of improved civilisation\nwhich from time to time during the last ten years the Indian\nGovernment had been urged by Parliament to take. Mr Vernon Smith\nfollowed, and in a very able speech answered in great detail Mr\nDisraeli's allegations. Sir Erskine Perry, who evidently had\nfurnished Mr Disraeli with much of his mistaken assertions, supported\nhis views. Mr Campbell, Member for Weymouth, who had been many years\nin India, showed the fallacy of Mr Disraeli's arguments, and the\ngroundlessness of many of his assertions. Mr Whiteside supported\nthe Motion. Lord John Russell, who had after Mr Disraeli's speech\ncommunicated with the Government, expressed his disapprobation of\nMr Disraeli's speech, and moved as an Amendment an Address to your\nMajesty expressing the assurance of the support of the House for\nmeasures to suppress the present disturbances, and their co-operation\nwith your Majesty in measures for the permanent establishment of\ntranquillity and contentment in India. Mr Mangles, the Chairman\nof the Directors, replied at much length, and very conclusively to Mr\nDisraeli's speech. Mr Liddell, with much simplicity, asked the Speaker\nto tell him how he should vote, but approved entirely of Lord John\nRussell's address. Mr Ayrton moved an adjournment of the Debate, which\nwas negatived by 203 to 79. Mr Hadfield then shortly stated in his\nprovincial dialect that \"we can never keep our 'old upon Hindia by\nthe Force of Harms.\" Mr Disraeli then made an animated reply to the\nspeeches against him, but in a manner almost too animated for the\noccasion. Mr Thomas Baring set Mr Disraeli right, but in rather strong\nterms, about some proceedings of the Committee on Indian Affairs\nin 1853, with regard to which Mr Disraeli's memory had proved\nuntrustworthy. Viscount Palmerston shortly made some observations on\nthe Motion and the speech which had introduced it; and the Motion was\nthen negatived without a division, and the Address was unanimously\ncarried.",

    "body": "Lord Canning presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and asks leave\nagain to address your Majesty, although the desire which he has felt\nthat his next letter should announce to your Majesty the fall of\nDelhi, and the first steps towards a restoration of your Majesty's\nAuthority throughout the revolted Districts, cannot as yet be\naccomplished. But although it is not in Lord Canning's power to report\nany very marked success over the Rebels, he can confidently assure\nyour Majesty that a change in the aspect of affairs is gradually\ntaking place, which gives hope that the contest is drawing to a close,\nand the day of punishment at hand....\nAnother ground for good hopes is the appearance of things at Lucknow.\nNews just received from Sir James Outram announces that he has joined\nGeneral Havelock's force at Cawnpore, and that the Troops crossed the\nGanges into Oudh on the 19th, with hardly any opposition. The European\nforce now advancing on Lucknow is about [....] strong, well\nprovided with Artillery. The beleaguered Garrison was in good spirits\non the 16th of September, and had provisions enough to last to the\nend of the month. They had lately inflicted severe losses on their\nassailants, and some of the latter had dispersed. The influential\nproprietors and chiefs of the country had begun to show symptoms of\nsiding with us.\nThis is a very different state of things from that which existed when\nGeneral Havelock's force retired across the Ganges in July; and Lord\nCanning prays and believes that your Majesty will be spared the\npain and horror of hearing that the atrocities of Cawnpore have been\nre-enacted upon the brave and enduring garrison of Lucknow. Every\nEnglish soldier who could be made to reach Cawnpore has been pushed\non to General Outram, even to the denuding of some points of danger\nin the intervening country, and General Outram's instructions are to\nconsider the rescue of the garrison as the one paramount object to\nwhich everything else is to give way. The garrison (which, after all,\nis nothing more than the House of the Resident, with defences hastily\nthrown up) contains about three hundred and fifty European men, four\nhundred and fifty women and children, and one hundred and twenty sick,\nbesides three hundred natives, hitherto faithful. The city, and even\nthe province, may be abandoned and recovered again, but these lives\nmust be saved now or never; and to escape the sorrow and humiliation\nof such barbarities as have already been endured elsewhere is worth\nany sacrifice. It is in consideration of the state of things at\nthese two most critical points, Delhi and Lucknow, that Lord Canning\nventures to ask your Majesty to look hopefully to the events of the\nnext few weeks; notwithstanding that he is unable to announce any\nsignal success....\nSir Colin Campbell has been in a state of delight ever since his\nfavourite 93rd landed five days ago. He went to see them on board\ntheir transport before they disembarked, and when Lord Canning asked\nhow he found them, replied that the only thing amiss was that they had\nbecome too fat on the voyage, and could not button their coats. But,\nindeed, all the troops of the China force have been landed in the\nhighest possible condition of health and vigour. The 23rd, from its\nlarge proportion of young soldiers, is perhaps the one most likely\nto suffer from the climate and the hardships of the Service--for,\nalthough no care or cost will be spared to keep them in health and\ncomfort, Lord Canning fears that hardships there must be, seeing how\nvast an extent of usually productive country will be barren for a\ntime, and that the districts from which some of our most valuable\nsupplies, especially the supply of carriage animals, are drawn,\nhave been stripped bare, or are still in revolt. As it is, the\nCommander-in-Chief has most wisely reduced the amount of tent\naccommodation for officers and men far below the ordinary luxurious\nIndian allowance.\nThe presence of the ships of the Royal Navy has been of the greatest\nservice. At least eleven thousand seamen and marines have been\ncontributed by them for duty on shore, and the broadsides of the\n_Sanspareil_, _Shannon_, and _Pearl_, as they lie along the esplanade,\nhave had a very reassuring effect upon the inhabitants of Calcutta,\nwho, until lately, have insisted pertinaciously that their lives and\nproperty were in hourly danger.\nNo line-of-battle ship has been seen in the Hooghly since Admiral\nWatson sailed up to Chandernagore just a hundred years ago; and\ncertainly nothing in his fleet was equal to the _Sanspareil_. The\nnatives stare at her, and call her \"the four-storied boat.\"\nFor the future, if Delhi should fall and Lucknow be secured, the work\nof pacification will go forward steadily. Many points will have to be\nwatched, and there may be occasional resistance; but nothing like\nan organised contest against authority is probable. The greatest\ndifficulties will be in the civil work of re-settlement. The recent\ndeath of Mr Colvin, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western\nProvinces, has removed an officer whose experience would there have\nbeen most valuable. He has died, fairly exhausted; and is the fourth\nofficer of high trust whose life has given way in the last four\nmonths.\nOne of the greatest difficulties which lie ahead--and Lord Canning\ngrieves to say so to your Majesty--will be the violent rancour of a\nvery large proportion of the English community against every\nnative Indian of every class. There is a rabid and indiscriminate\nvindictiveness abroad, even amongst many who ought to set a better\nexample, which it is impossible to contemplate without something like\na feeling of shame for one's fellow-countrymen. Not one man in\nten seems to think that the hanging and shooting of forty or fifty\nthousand mutineers, besides other Rebels, can be otherwise than\npracticable and right; nor does it occur to those who talk and write\nmost upon the matter that for the Sovereign of England to hold and\ngovern India without employing, and, to a great degree, trusting\nnatives, both in civil and military service, is simply impossible. It\nis no exaggeration to say that a vast number of the European community\nwould hear with pleasure and approval that every Hindoo and Mohammedan\nhad been proscribed, and that none would be admitted to serve the\nGovernment except in a menial office. That which they desire is to see\na broad line of separation, and of declared distrust drawn between us\nEnglishmen and every subject of your Majesty who is not a Christian,\nand who has a dark skin; and there are some who entirely refuse\nto believe in the fidelity or goodwill of any native towards any\nEuropean; although many instances of the kindness and generosity\nof both Hindoos and Mohammedans have come upon record during these\ntroubles.\nTo those whose hearts have been torn by the foul barbarities inflicted\nupon those dear to them any degree of bitterness against the natives\nmay be excused. No man will dare to judge them for it. But the cry is\nraised loudest by those who have been sitting quietly in their homes\nfrom the beginning and have suffered little from the convulsions\naround them unless it be in pocket. It is to be feared that this\nfeeling of exasperation will be a great impediment in the way of\nrestoring tranquillity and good order, even after signal retribution\nshall have been deliberately measured out to all chief offenders.\nLord Canning is ashamed of having trespassed upon your Majesty's\nindulgence at such length. He will only add that he has taken the\nliberty of sending to your Majesty by this mail a map which has just\nbeen finished, showing the distribution of the Army throughout India\nat the time of the outbreak of the Mutiny. It also shows the Regiments\nof the Bengal Army which have mutinied, and those which have been\ndisarmed, the number of European troops arrived in Calcutta up to the\n19th of September, and whence they came; with some few other points of\ninformation.\nThere may be some slight inaccuracies, as the first copies of the map\nhave only just been struck off, and have not been corrected; but Lord\nCanning believes that it will be interesting to your Majesty at the\npresent moment.\nLord Canning begs to be allowed to express his earnest wishes for the\nhealth of your Majesty, and of His Royal Highness Prince Albert,\nand to offer to your Majesty the humble assurance of his sincere and\ndutiful devotion.",

    "body": "Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\nto state that the condition of financial affairs became worse to-day\nthan it was yesterday. The Governor of the bank represented that\nalmost all private firms have ceased to discount bills, and that the\nReserve Fund of the Bank of England, out of which discounts are made\nand liabilities satisfied, had been reduced last night to \u00a31,400,000,\nand that if that fund should become exhausted the bank would have\nto suspend its operations. Under these circumstances it appeared to\nViscount Palmerston, and to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that a\ncase had arisen for doing the same thing which was done under somewhat\nsimilar circumstances in 1847--that is to say, that a letter should\nbe written by the first Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the\nExchequer to the Governor of the Bank of England, saying that if under\nthe pressure of the emergency the bank should deem it necessary to\nissue more notes than the amount to which they are at present confined\nby law, the Government would apply to Parliament to grant them an\nindemnity.\nThis Measure, in 1847, had the effect of stopping the then existing\npanic, and the necessity for making such an issue did not arise; on\nthe present occasion this announcement will, no doubt, have a salutary\neffect in allaying the present panic, but as the bank had to discount\nto-day bills to the amount of \u00a32,000,000, which they could not have\ndone out of a fund of \u00a31,400,000, unless deposits and payments in,\nto a considerable amount, had been made, the probability is that\nthe issue thus authorised will actually be made. The Governor and\nDeputy-Governor of the bank represented that the communication,\nin order to be effectual and to save from ruin firms which were in\nimminent danger, ought to be made forthwith, so that they might be\nenabled to announce it on the Stock Exchange before the closing of\nbusiness at four o'clock. Viscount Palmerston and Sir George Lewis\ntherefore signed at once, and gave to the Governor of the bank the\nletter of which the accompanying paper is a copy, the pressure of the\nmatter not allowing time to take your Majesty's pleasure beforehand.\nThe state of things now is more urgent than that which existed in\n1847, when the similar step was taken; at that time the Reserve Fund\nwas about \u00a31,900,000, last night it was only \u00a31,400,000; at that time\nthe bullion in the bank was above \u00a38,000,000, it is now somewhat\nless than \u00a38,000,000; at that time things were mending, they are now\ngetting worse.\nBut however necessary this Measure has been considered, and however\nuseful it may be expected to be, it inevitably entails one very\ninconvenient consequence. The Government have authorised the bank to\nbreak the law, and whether the law shall actually be broken or not,\nit would be highly unconstitutional for the Government not to take\nthe earliest opportunity of submitting the matter to the knowledge of\nParliament. This course was pursued in 1847. The letter from Lord John\nRussell and Sir Charles Wood to the Governor of the bank was dated on\nthe 25th October, Parliament then stood prorogued in the usual way\nto the 11th November, but a council was held on the 31st October, at\nwhich your Majesty summoned Parliament to meet for the despatch of\nbusiness on the 18th November; and on that day the session was opened\nin the usual way by a Speech from the Throne. It would be impossible\nunder present circumstances to put off till the beginning of February\na communication to Parliament of the step taken to-day.\nViscount Palmerston therefore would beg to submit for your Majesty's\napproval that a Council might be held at Windsor on Monday next, and\nthat Parliament might then be summoned to meet in fourteen days. This\nwould bring Parliament together in the first days of December, and\nafter sitting ten days, or a fortnight, if necessary, it might be\nadjourned till the first week in February.\nViscount Palmerston submits an explanatory Memorandum which he has\njust received for your Majesty's information from the Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer....",

Last year we reduced our Army suddenly to a low peace\nestablishment to meet the demand for reduction of taxation raised in\nthe House of Commons. With this peace establishment we had to meet the\nextraordinary demands of India, we have sent almost every available\nregiment, battalion, and battery, and are forced to contemplate the\ncertainty of a large increase of our force in India as a permanent\nnecessity. What the Queen requires is, that a well-considered and\ndigested estimate should be made of the additional regiments, etc.,\netc., so required, and that after deducting this number from our\nestablishment of 1857-1858, that for the next year should be brought\nup again to the same condition as if the Indian demand, which is\nforeign to our ordinary consideration, had not arisen. If this be done\nit will still leave us militarily weaker than we were at the beginning\nof the year, for the larger English Army maintained in India will\nrequire proportionally more reliefs and larger dep\u00f4ts.\nAs the Indian finances pay for the troops employed in India, the Force\nat home and in the colonies will, when raised to its old strength,\nnot cost a shilling more than the peace establishment of 1857 settled\nunder a pressure of financial reduction.\nAnything less than this will not leave this country in a safe\ncondition. The Queen does not ask only for the same number of men as\nin 1857-1858, but particularly for Regiments of Cavalry, Battalions\nof Infantry and Batteries of Artillery, which alone would enable us in\ncase of a war to effect the increase to a war establishment.\nThe Queen encloses her answer to Lord Panmure's last letter.",

As long as the Government was that of the\nCompany, the Sovereign was generally left quite ignorant of decisions\nand despatches; now that the Government is to be that of the\nSovereign, and the direction will, she presumes, be given in her name,\na direct official responsibility to her will have to be established.\nShe doubts whether any one but a Secretary of State could speak in\nthe Queen's name, like the Foreign Secretary to Foreign Courts, the\nColonial Secretary to the Governors of the Colonies, and the Home\nSecretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and the Lieutenants of\nthe Counties of Great Britain, the Judges, Convocations, Mayors, etc.,\netc. On the other hand, would the position of a Secretary of State\nbe compatible with his being President of a Council? The Treasury\nand Admiralty act as \"My Lords,\" but they only administer special\ndepartments, and do not direct the policy of a country in the Queen's\nname. The mixture of supreme direction, and also of the conduct of the\nadministration of the department to be directed, has in practice\nbeen found as inconvenient in the War Department as it is wrong in\nprinciple.\nThe other point is the importance of having only _one_ Army, whether\nnative, local, or general, with one discipline and one command,\nthat of the Commander-in-Chief. This is quite compatible with first\nappointments to the native Army, being vested as a point of patronage\nin the members of the Council, but it ought to be distinctly\nrecognised in order to do away with those miserable jealousies between\nthe different military services, which have done more harm to us in\nIndia than, perhaps, any other circumstance.\nPerhaps Lord Palmerston would circulate this letter amongst the\nmembers of the Committee who agreed upon the proposed scheme?",

Your Majesty's\ngracious kindness in the reference made by your Majesty to what is\nsaid by the newspapers is also deeply felt by Lord Canning. He can\ntruly and conscientiously assure your Majesty of his indifference to\nall such attacks--an indifference so complete indeed as to surprise\nhimself.\nLord Canning fears that the satisfaction which your Majesty will have\nexperienced very shortly after the date of your Majesty's letter, upon\nreceiving the news of Sir Henry Havelock's entry into Lucknow, will\nhave been painfully checked by the long and apparently blank interval\nwhich followed, and during which your Majesty's anxieties for the\nultimate safety of the garrison, largely increased by many precious\nlives, must have become more intense than ever. Happily, this suspense\nis over; and the real rescue effected by a glorious combination of\nskill and intrepidity on the part of Sir Colin Campbell and his troops\nmust have been truly gratifying to your Majesty. The defence of\nLucknow and the relief of the defenders are two exploits which,\neach in their kind, will stand out brightly in the history of these\nterrible times.\n... Lord Canning has not failed to transmit your Majesty's gracious\nmessage to Sir Colin Campbell, and has taken the liberty to add your\nMajesty's words respecting his favourite 93rd, which will not be\nless grateful to the brave old soldier than the expression of your\nMajesty's consideration for himself.\nYour Majesty has lost two most valuable officers in Sir Henry Havelock\nand Brigadier-General Neill. They were very different, however. The\nfirst was quite of the old school--severe and precise with his men,\nand very cautious in his movements and plans--but in action bold\nas well as skilful. The second very open and impetuous, but full of\nresources; and to his soldiers as kind and thoughtful of their comfort\nas if they had been his children.\nWith earnest wishes for the health and happiness of your Majesty and\nthe Prince, Lord Canning begs permission to lay at your Majesty's feet\nthe assurance of his most dutiful and devoted attachment.",

Lord Panmure admits that the two plans don't differ\nmaterially in expense. It becomes, then, a mere question of\norganisation and of policy. As to the first, all military authorities\nof all countries and times agree upon the point that numerous _cadres_\nwith fewer men give the readiest means of increasing an army on short\nnotice, the main point to be attended to in a constitutional and\ndemocratic country like England. As to the second, a system of\norganisation will always be easier defended than mere numbers\narbitrarily fixed, and Parliament ought to have the possibility of\nvoting more or voting fewer men, according to their views of the\nexigencies of the country, or the pressure of finance at different\ntimes, and to be able to do so without deranging the organisation.\nThe Queen hopes Lord Panmure will look at our position, as if the\nIndian demands had not arisen, and he will find that to come to\nParliament with the Cavalry borne on the estimates reduced by three\nregiments (as will be the case even after two shall have returned from\nIndia, and the two new ones shall have been formed), will certainly\nnot prove _too little_ anxiety on the part of the Government to cut\ndown our military establishments.",

Mr Baines\nfollowed, but only argued the Bill without replying to Mr Gibson's\nspeech. This was remarked upon by Mr Walpole, who followed him, and\nwho said that though he approved of the Bill he could not vote for\nreading it a second time until Count Walewski's despatch had been\nanswered. Mr MacMahon supported the Amendment, as did Mr Byng. Sir\nGeorge Grey, who followed Mr Walpole, defended the Bill and the course\npursued by the Government in not having answered Count Walewski's\ndespatch until after the House of Commons should have affirmed the\nBill by a Second Reading. Mr Spooner remained steady to his purpose,\nand would vote against the Amendment, though in doing so he should\ndiffer from his friends. Lord Harry Vane opposed the Amendment, as\ninterfering with the passing of the Bill, and Mr Bentinck took the\nsame line, and replied to some of the arguments of Mr Milner Gibson.\nMr Henley said he should vote for the Amendment. The Lord Advocate\nmade a good speech against it. Mr Gladstone spoke with his\nusual talent in favour of the Amendment, and was answered by the\nAttorney-General in a speech which would have convinced men who had\nnot taken a previous determination. He was followed by Mr Disraeli,\nwho seemed confident of success, and he was replied to by Viscount\nPalmerston, and the House then divided.\nIt seems that Lord Derby had caught at an opportunity of putting the\nGovernment in a minority. He saw that there were ninety-nine Members\nwho were chiefly of the Liberal Party, who had voted against the Bill\nwhen it was first proposed, and who were determined to oppose it in\nall its stages. He calculated that if his own followers were to join\nthose ninety-nine, the Government might be run hard, or perhaps be\nbeaten, and he desired all his friends to support Mr Milner Gibson;\non the other hand, many of the supporters of the Government, relying\nupon the majority of 200, by which the leave to bring the Bill in had\nbeen carried, and upon the majority of 145 of last night, had gone out\nof town for a few days, not anticipating any danger to the Government\nfrom Mr Gibson's Motion, and thus an adverse division was obtained.\nMoreover, Count Walewski's despatch, the tone and tenor of which had\nbeen much misrepresented, had produced a very unfavourable effect on\nthe mind of members in general, and there was a prevailing feeling\nvery difficult to overcome, that the proposed Bill was somehow or\nother a concession to the demand of a Foreign Government. The Cabinet\nwill have to consider at its meeting at three o'clock to-morrow what\ncourse the Government will have to pursue.",

    "body": "Lord Palmerston came at five o'clock from the Cabinet, and tendered\nhis resignation in his own name, and that of his Colleagues. The\nCabinet had well considered their position and found that, as the vote\npassed by the House, although the result of an accidental combination\nof parties, was virtually a vote of censure upon their conduct, they\ncould not with honour or with any advantage to the public service\ncarry on the Government.\nThe combination was the whole of the Conservative Party (Lord Derby's\nfollowers), Lord John Russell, the Peelites, with Mr Gladstone and\nthe whole of the Radicals; but the Liberal Party generally is just now\nvery angry with Lord Palmerston personally, chiefly on account of his\napparent submission to French dictation, and the late appointment of\nLord Clanricarde as Privy Seal, who is looked upon as a reprobate.\nLord Clanricarde's presence in the House of Commons during the Debate,\nand in a conspicuous place, enraged many supporters of Lord Palmerston\nto that degree that they voted at once with the Opposition.\nThe Queen wrote to Lord Derby the letter here following; he came a\nlittle after six o'clock. He stated that nobody was more surprised\nin his life than he had been at the result of the Debate, after the\nGovernment had only a few days before had a majority of more than 100\non the introduction of their Bill. He did not know how it came about,\nbut thought it was the work of Lord John Russell and Sir James Graham\nin the interest of the Radicals; Mr Gladstone's junction must have\nbeen accidental. As to his own people, they had, owing to his\nown personal exertions, as the Queen was aware, though many very\nunwillingly, supported the Bill; but the amendment of Mr Milner Gibson\nwas so skilfully worded, that it was difficult for them not to vote\nfor it; he had to admit this when they came to him to ask what they\nshould do, merely warning them to save the Measure itself, which the\nAmendment did. He then blamed the Government very much for leaving\nCount Walewski's despatch unanswered before coming before Parliament,\nwhich he could hardly understand.\nOn the Queen telling him that the Government had resigned, and that\nshe commissioned him to form a new Administration, he begged that\nthis offer might not be made to him without further consideration, and\nwould state clearly his own position. After what had happened in 1851\nand 1855, if the Queen made the offer he _must_ accept it, for if he\nrefused, the Conservative Party would be broken up for ever. Yet\nhe would find a majority of two to one against him in the House of\nCommons, would have difficulty in well filling the important offices,\nfound the external and internal relations of the country in a\nmost delicate and complicated position, war in India and in China,\ndifficulties with France, the Indian Bill introduced and a Reform\nBill promised; nothing but the forbearance and support of some of his\nopponents would make it possible for him to carry on any Government.\nThe person who was asked first by the Sovereign had always a great\ndisadvantage; perhaps other combinations were possible, which, if\nfound not to answer, would make him more readily accepted by the\ncountry. The position of Lord Palmerston was a most curious one,\nthe House of Commons had been returned chiefly for the purpose of\nsupporting him _personally_, and he had obtained a working majority\nof 100 (unheard of since the Reform Bill), yet his supporters had no\nprinciples in common and they generally suspected him; the question of\nthe Reform Bill had made him and Lord John run a race for popularity\nwhich might lead to disastrous consequences. Lord Derby did not at all\nknow what support he would be able to obtain in Parliament.\nThe Queen agreed to deferring her offer, and to take further time for\nconsideration on the understanding that if she made it it would at\nonce be accepted. Lord Derby expressed, however, his fear that the\nresignation of the Palmerston Cabinet might only be for the purpose of\ngoing through a crisis in order to come back again with new strength,\nfor there existed different kinds of resignations, some for this\npurpose, others really for abandoning office.\nA conversation which I had with Lord Clarendon after dinner, convinced\nme that the Cabinet had sent in their resignations from the real\nconviction of the impossibility to go on with honour and success; all\noffers of the friends of the Government to pass a vote of confidence,\netc., etc., had been rejected. Lord Derby was the only man who could\nform a Government; Mr Gladstone would probably join him. The whole\nmove had been planned, and most dexterously, by Sir James Graham.\nALBERT.",

Lord Malmesbury has carefully abstained from\ngiving Lord Cowley or M. de Persigny the slightest hope that we could\nalter the law, but has confined himself to saying that the law was\nitself as much on its trial as the prisoners Bernard and Truelove.\nIf, therefore, the law should prove to be a phantom of justice, or\nanomalous in its action, whatever measures your Majesty's Government\nmay hereafter take to reform it, it will be received by France as an\nunexpected boon and a proof of good faith and amity.\nIn attending to the idea referred to by your Majesty that the Emperor\ntook the oath of the Assassins' Society, Lord Malmesbury can almost\nassure your Majesty that such is not the case. Lord Malmesbury\nfirst made His Majesty's acquaintance in Italy when they were both\nvery young men (twenty years of age). They were _both_ under the\ninfluence of those romantic feelings which the former history and\nthe present degradation of Italy may naturally inspire even at a more\nadvanced time of life--and the Prince Louis Napoleon, to the knowledge\nof Lord Malmesbury, certainly engaged himself in the conspiracies of\nthe time--but it was with the higher class of the Carbonari, men like\nGeneral Sercognani and General P\u00e9p\u00e9. The Prince used to talk to Lord\nMalmesbury upon these men and their ideas and plans with all the\nopenness that exists between two youths, and Lord Malmesbury has many\ntimes heard him condemn with disgust the societies of villains which\nhung on the flank of the conspirators, and which deterred many of the\nbest families and ablest gentlemen in Romagna from joining them. Lord\nMalmesbury believes the report therefore to be a fable, and at some\nfuture period will, if it should interest your Majesty, relate to\nyour Majesty some details respecting the Emperor's share in the\nconspiracies of 1828-1829....",

Lord Derby hoped that this resignation would stop\nthe vote of censure in the House of Commons, as the House could not\nhold responsible and punish the Cabinet for that with which they had\nhad no concern. If the House persisted, it was clear that the motives\nwere factious, and he hoped the Queen would allow him to threaten a\nDissolution of Parliament, which he was certain would stop it. The\nQueen refused to give that permission; she said he might leave it\nquite undecided whether the Queen would grant a Dissolution or not,\nand take the benefit of the doubt in talking to others on the subject;\nbut she must be left quite free to act as she thought the good of the\ncountry might require at the time when the Government should have been\nbeat; there had been a Dissolution within the year, and if a Reform\nBill was passed there must be another immediately upon it; in the\nmeantime most violent pledges would be taken as to Reform if a general\nelection were to take place now. Lord Derby concurred in all this, and\nsaid he advised the threat particularly in order to render the reality\nunnecessary; when she persisted in her refusal, however, on the\nground that she could not threaten what she was not prepared to do, he\nappeared very much disappointed and mortified.\nWe then discussed the state of the question itself, and urged the\nnecessity of something being done to do away with the injurious\nimpression which the publication of the despatch must produce in\nIndia, as the resignation of Lord Ellenborough left this quite\nuntouched, and Parliament might with justice demand this. He agreed,\nafter much difficulty, to send a telegraphic despatch, which might\novertake and mitigate the other. On my remark that the public were\nunder the impression that there had been collusion, and that Mr Bright\nhad seen the despatch before he asked his question for its production,\nhe denied this stoutly, but let us understand that Mr Bright had\nknown of the existence of such a despatch, and had wished to put his\nquestion before, but had been asked to defer it until Lord Canning's\nProclamation should have appeared in the newspapers!

Lord Grey shortly entered\nhis protest against bringing into discussion the policy of the\nProclamation and of the consequent despatch, into which Lord\nEllenborough had certainly entered too largely, opposing, very\nbroadly, the principle of confiscation against that of clemency. Lord\nDerby followed Lord Grey, and after an interruption on a point of\nform, vindicated the policy advocated in Lord Ellenborough's despatch,\nat the same time that he expressed not only his hope, but his belief,\nthat in practice the Governor-General would be found (and more\nespecially judging from the alterations inserted in the last\nProclamation of which an unofficial copy has been received) acting\non the principles laid down in Lord Ellenborough's despatch. In the\ntribute which he felt it his duty to pay to the personal, as well as\npolitical, character of Lord Ellenborough, the House concurred with\nentire unanimity and all did honour to the spirit which induced him\nto sacrifice his own position to the public service; and to atone, and\nmore than atone, for an act of indiscretion by the frank avowal that\nhe alone was responsible for it. Lord Derby thinks that the step which\nhas been taken may, even probably, prevent the Motions intended to\nbe made on Friday; and if made, will, almost certainly, result in a\nmajority for the Government.\nLord Derby believes that he may possibly be in time to telegraph\nto Malta early to-morrow, to Lord Canning. In that case he will\ndo himself the honour of submitting to your Majesty a copy of the\nmessage sent, though he fears it will be impossible to do\nso before its despatch. He proposes in substance to say that the\npublication has been disapproved--that Lord Ellenborough has resigned\nin consequence--but that your Majesty's Government adhere in principle\nto the policy laid down in the despatch of 19th April, and entertain\nan earnest hope that the Governor-General, judging from the\nmodifications introduced into the amended Proclamation, has, in fact,\nthe intention of acting in the same spirit; but that your Majesty's\nGovernment are still of opinion that confiscation of private property\nought to be made the exception, and not the rule, and to be enforced\nonly against those who may stand out after a certain day, or who may\nbe proved to have been guilty of more than ordinary crimes.\nLord Derby hopes that your Majesty will excuse a very hasty sketch of\na very large subject.",

Login, who holds the same opinion, and has great Indian\nexperience, does not find any fault with the Proclamation, however\nseemingly it may sound at variance with these opinions, and this on\naccount of the peculiar position of affairs in Oudh. It is a great\npity that Lord Ellenborough, with his knowledge, experience, activity,\nand cleverness, should be so entirely unable to submit to general\nrules of conduct. The Queen has been for some time much alarmed at his\nwriting letters of his own to all the most important Indian Chiefs\nand Kings explaining his policy. All this renders the position of a\nGovernor-General almost untenable, and that of the Government at home\nvery hazardous.",

    "body": "Upon being admitted to Lord Aberdeen, I informed him that the Queen\nand Prince were anxious to hear his opinion upon the present most\nunfortunate state of affairs, but that, knowing how easily every event\nwas perverted in such times as the present, Her Majesty and His\nRoyal Highness had thought that it might have been subject to\nmisapprehension had he been known to have been at Buckingham Palace,\nand that I had been therefore directed to call upon him, with a view\nof obtaining his opinion and advice upon certain important points.\nThe first was the question of a Dissolution of Parliament in the\nevent of the Government being defeated upon the question which was at\npresent pending. I told him that I was permitted to communicate to him\nin the strictest confidence, that in a late Audience which Lord Derby\nhad with the Queen, he had asked her permission to be allowed to\nannounce that, in the event of an adverse majority, he had Her\nMajesty's sanction to a Dissolution of Parliament.\nThat the Queen had declined to give such sanction, or even such a\npledge, and equally guarded herself against being supposed to have\nmade up her mind to refuse her sanction to a Dissolution, had told\nLord Derby that she could not then make any prospective decision\nupon the subject. I told him that in point of fact Her Majesty was\ndisinclined to grant to Lord Derby her authority for a Dissolution,\nbut that the Queen had at once refused to grant to Lord Derby her\nsanction for making the announcement he wished, as she considered that\nit would be a very unconstitutional threat for him to hold over the\nhead of the Parliament, with her authority, by way of biassing their\ndecision.\nLord Aberdeen interrupted me by saying that the Queen had done quite\nright--that he never heard of such a request being made, or authority\nfor such an announcement being sought--and he could not at all\nunderstand Lord Derby making such an application. He knew that the\nGovernment had threatened a Dissolution, that he thought that they had\na perfect right to do so, but that they would have been quite wrong in\njoining the Queen's name with it.\nHe said that he had never entertained the slightest doubt that if\nthe Minister advised the Queen to dissolve, she would, as a matter\nof course, do so. The Minister who advised the Dissolution took upon\nhimself the heavy responsibility of doing so, but that the Sovereign\nwas bound to suppose that the person whom she had appointed as a\nMinister was a gentleman and an honest man, and that he would not\nadvise Her Majesty to take such a step unless he thought that it\nwas for the good of the country. There was no doubt of the power and\nprerogative of the Sovereign to refuse a Dissolution--it was one\nof the very few acts which the Queen of England could do without\nresponsible advice at the moment; but even in this case whoever\nwas sent for to succeed, must, with his appointment, assume\nthe responsibility of this act, and be prepared to defend it in\nParliament.\nHe could not remember a single instance in which the undoubted power\nof the Sovereign had been exercised upon this point, and the advice of\nthe Minister to dissolve Parliament had been rejected--for it was\nto be remembered that Lord Derby would be still at this time her\nMinister--and that the result of such refusal would be that the Queen\nwould take upon herself the act of dismissing Lord Derby from office,\ninstead of his resigning from being unable longer to carry on the\nGovernment.\nThe Queen had during her reign, and throughout the numerous changes\nof Government, maintained an unassailable position of constitutional\nimpartiality, and he had no hesitation in saying that he thought it\nwould be more right, and certainly more safe, for her to follow the\nusual course, than to take this dangerous time for exercising an\nunusual and, he believed he might say, an unprecedented, course,\nthough the power to exercise the authority was undoubted.\nHe said that he did not conceive that any reasons of expediency as\nto public business, or the possible effects of frequent general\nelections, would be sufficient grounds for refusing a Dissolution (and\nreasons would have to be given by the new Minister in Parliament),\nand, as he conceived, the only possible ground that could be\nmaintained as foundation for such an exercise of authority would be\nthe fearful danger to the existence of our power in India, which\nmight arise from the intemperate discussion upon every hustings of\nthe proceedings of the Government with respect to that country--as the\nquestion proposed to the country would certainly be considered to be\nseverity or mercy to the people of India.\nUpon the second point, as to a successor to Lord Derby in the event\nof his resignation, he said that the Queen would, he thought, have no\nalternative but to send for Lord Palmerston. The only other person who\ncould be suggested would be Lord John Russell, and he was neither\nthe mover of the Resolutions which displaced the Government, nor the\nostensible head of the Opposition, which the late meeting at Cambridge\nHouse pointed out Lord Palmerston to be. That he was not very fond of\nLord Palmerston, though he had forgiven him all, and he had had _much_\nto forgive; and that in the last few days it had appeared that he had\nless following than Lord John; but the Queen could not act upon such\ndaily changing circumstances, and it was evident that Lord Palmerston\nwas the ostensible man for the Queen to send for.\nLord Aberdeen seemed very low upon the state of public affairs. He\nsaid that the extreme Liberals were the only Party that appeared to\ngain strength. Not only was the Whig Party divided within itself,\nhated by the Radicals, and having a very doubtful support from the\nindependent Liberals, but even the little band called the Peelites had\nentirely crumbled to pieces. In the House of Lords, whilst the Duke of\nNewcastle voted with the Opposition, he (Lord Aberdeen) had purposely\nabstained from voting, whilst, in the House of Commons, Cardwell moved\nthe Resolution, and Mr Sidney Herbert would, he believed, vote for it;\nGladstone would speak on the other side, and Sir J. Graham would also\nvote with the Government.\nHe concluded by saying that if the majority against the Government\nwas a very large one, he thought that Lord Derby ought not to ask to\ndissolve; but that he knew that the members of the Government had said\nthat the present Parliament was elected upon a momentary Palmerstonian\ncry, and was quite an exceptional case, and that they would not\nconsent to be driven from office upon its verdict.",

He begged again to\nbe empowered to contradict the assertion. The Queen maintained that it\nwould be quite unconstitutional to threaten Parliament, and to use\nher name for that purpose. Lord Derby quite agreed, and disclaimed any\nsuch intention, but said there were modes of letting the fact be known\nwithout any risk. We agreed that we could not enter into such details.\nThe Queen allowed him (Lord Derby) to know that a Dissolution would\nnot be refused to him, and trusted that her honour would be safe in\nhis hands as to the use he made of that knowledge. He seemed greatly\nrelieved, and stated that had he had to resign, he would have\nwithdrawn from public business, and the Conservative Party would have\nbeen entirely, and he feared for ever, broken up.

    "body": "Lord Derby, with his humble duty, gratefully acknowledges your\nMajesty's gracious letter just received, and the telegraphic message\nwith which he was honoured in answer to his on Friday night. Your\nMajesty can hardly be expected to estimate, at a distance from the\nimmediate scene of action, the effect of the event of that evening.\nIt was the utter explosion of a well-constructed mine, under the feet,\nnot of the assailed, but of the assailants; and the effect has been\nthe greater from the immense attendance in London of Members of the\nHouse of Commons. No effort had been spared. Lord Castlerosse, only\njust married, had been sent for from Italy--but Lord Derby hopes that\nhe had not been induced to come--for nothing. It is said that of\nthe 654 Members of whom the House is composed, 626 were actually\nin London. The Government could rely on 304 to 308, and the whole\nquestion turned on the absence, or the conversion, of a small number\nof \"Liberal\" Members. The result is to be attributed to two causes;\nfirst, and principally, to the fear of a Dissolution, and to the\ngrowing conviction that in case of necessity your Majesty would\nsanction such a course, which had been strenuously denied by Lord\nPalmerston--and in which Lord Derby hopes that your Majesty will have\nseen that your Majesty's name has never, for a moment, been brought in\nquestion; and secondly, to the effect produced by the correspondence\nbetween the Governor-General and Sir James Outram. And here\nLord Derby may perhaps be allowed the opportunity of removing a\nmisconception from your Majesty's mind, as to any secret intelligence\nor underhand intrigue between Lord Ellenborough and Sir James Outram,\nto the detriment of Lord Canning. Lord Derby is in the position\nto know that if there is one person in the world to whom Lord\nEllenborough has an utter aversion, and with whom he has no personal\nor private correspondence, it is Sir James Outram. Anything therefore\nin common in their opinions must be the result of circumstances wholly\nirrespective of private concert. Lord Derby has written fully to Lord\nCanning, privately, by the mail which will go out on Tuesday; and\nwhile he has not concealed from him the opinion of your Majesty's\nservants that the Proclamation, of which so much has been said,\nconveyed too sweeping an Edict of Confiscation against the landowners,\ngreat and small, of Oudh, he has not hesitated to express also his\nconviction that Lord Canning's real intentions, in execution, would\nnot be found widely to differ from the views of your Majesty's\nservants. He has expressed to Lord Canning his regret at the premature\n_publication_ of the Draft Proclamation, at the same time that he has\npointed out the injustice done both to your Majesty's Government\nand to the Governor-General by the (Lord Derby will hardly call\nit fraudulent) suppression of the private letters addressed to the\nPresident of the Board of Control, and deprecating judgment on the\ntext of the Proclamation, until explanation should be received. Lord\nDerby cannot but be of opinion that this suppression, of which Lord\nPalmerston was fully cognisant, was an act which no political or party\ninterests were sufficient to justify.\nThe state of the Government, during the late crisis, was such as\nto render it impossible to make any arrangement for filling up Lord\nEllenborough's place at the Board of Control. Application has since\nbeen made to Mr Gladstone, with the offer of that post, or of that\nof the Colonial Department, which Lord Stanley would give up for the\nconvenience of your Majesty's Government, though unwillingly, for\nIndia. Mr Gladstone demurred, on the ground of not wishing to leave\nhis friends; but when pressed to name whom he would wish to bring with\nhim, he could name none. Finally, he has written to ask advice as to\nhis course of Sir James Graham, who has returned to Netherby, and\nof Lord Aberdeen; and by them he will probably be guided. Should he\nfinally refuse, Lord Stanley _must_ take India; and the Colonies must\nbe offered in the first instance to Sir E. B. Lytton, who probably\nwill refuse, as he wants a Peerage, and is doubtful of his\nre-election; and failing him, to Sir William Heathcote, the Member for\nthe University of Oxford, who, without official experience, has great\nParliamentary knowledge and influence, and, if he will accept, is\nquite equal to the duties of the office. Lord Derby trusts that your\nMajesty will forgive this long intrusion on your Majesty's patience.\nHe has preferred the risk of it, to leaving your Majesty uninformed as\nto anything which was going on, or contemplated....\nIf Lord Dalhousie should be in a state to converse upon public\naffairs, there is no one with whom Lord Derby could confer more\nconfidentially than with him; nor of whose judgment, though he regrets\nto differ with him as to the annexation of Oudh, he has a higher\nopinion. He will endeavour to ascertain what is his present state\nof health, which he fears is very unsatisfactory, and will see and\nconverse with him, if possible.",

Yet a House of Commons, having been elected solely for the\nobject, and on the ground of supporting Lord Palmerston personally\n(an instance in our Parliamentary history without parallel), holds him\nsuddenly in such abhorrence, that not satisfied with having upset his\nGovernment, which had been successful in all its policy, and thrown\nhim out, it will hardly listen to him when he speaks. He is frequently\nreceived with hooting, and throughout the last Session it sufficed\nthat [he] took up any cause for the whole House voting against\nit, even if contrary to the principles which they had themselves\nadvocated, merely to have the satisfaction of putting him into a\nminority. How can this be accounted for? The man who was without\nrhyme or reason stamped the only _English_ statesman, the champion of\nliberty, the man of the people, etc., etc., now, without his having\nchanged in any one respect, having still the same virtues and the same\nfaults that he always had, young and vigorous in his seventy-fifth\nyear, and having succeeded in his policy, is now considered the head\nof a clique, the man of intrigue, past his work, etc., etc.--in fact\nhated! and this throughout the country. I cannot explain the enigma\nexcept by supposing that people had before joined in a cry which they\nthought was popular without themselves believing what they said and\nwrote, and that they now do the same; that the Radicals used his name\nto destroy other statesmen and politicians, and are destroying him now\nin his turn; that they hoped to govern through him, and that they\nsee a better chance now of doing it through a weak and incapable Tory\nGovernment which has entered into a secret bargain for their support.\nStill the phenomenon remains most curious.\nLord Palmerston himself remains, outwardly at least, quite cheerful,\nand seems to care very little about his reverses; he speaks on all\nsubjects, bids for the Liberal support as before, even at the expense\nof his better conviction (as he used to do), and keeps as much as\npossible before the public; he made an official tour in Ireland, and\nis gone to visit the Emperor Napoleon at Paris; his Chinese policy\nupon which the general Dissolution had taken place in 1857 has just\nbeen crowned by the most complete success by the advantageous treaty\nsigned at Pekin by Lord Elgin; and yet even for this the public will\nnot allow him any credit.

    "body": "SIR,--After the Committee of the Cabinet on the Reform Bill, which\nsat this morning for five hours, Lord Stanley expressed a wish to have\nsome private conversation with me.\nAlthough I would willingly have deferred the interview till a moment\nwhen I was less exhausted, I did not think it wise, with a person of\nhis temperament, to baulk an occasion, and therefore assented at once.\nI give your Royal Highness faithfully, but feebly, and not completely,\nthe results of our conversation.\n1. With respect to the relations between his office and Her Majesty,\nhe said he was conscious that they had been conducted with great\ndeficiency of form, and, in many respects, in an unsatisfactory\nmanner; but he attributed all this to the inexperience and \"sheer\nignorance\" of a Department which had not been accustomed to direct\ncommunication with the Crown. Some portion of this, he said, he had\nalready remedied, and he wished to remedy all, though he experienced\ndifficulties, on some of which he consulted me.\nHe accepted, without reserve, and cordially, my position, that he must\nact always as the Minister of the Queen, and not of the Council, but\nhe said I took an exaggerated view of his relations with that body;\nthat he thoroughly knew their respective places, and should be\nvigilant that they did [? not] overstep their limits; that he had\nnever been, of which he reminded me, an admirer of the East India\nCompany, and had no intention of reviving their system; that the\nincident of submitting the legal case to the Council, etc., had\noriginated in a demand on the part of the Commander-in-Chief, which\ninvolved, if complied with, a grant of money, and that, under these\ncircumstances, an appeal to the Council was inevitable.\n2. He agreed with me, that, on all military matters, he would\nhabitually communicate with the Commander-in-Chief, and take His Royal\nHighness's advice on all such points; and that copies of all military\npapers, as I understood Lord Stanley, should be furnished to His Royal\nHighness.\n3. Having arrived at this point, I laid before him the views\nrespecting _military unity_, which formed the subject matter of\nrecent conversations. Lord Stanley assented to the principles which\nI attempted to enforce; and in reply to my reminding him that the\nold military system of India had entirely broken down, he said\nhe contemplated terminating the independent authority of the\nCommander-in-Chief at the inferior Presidencies, and of\nestablishing the absolute and complete authority of Her Majesty's\nCommander-in-Chief in India. He did not seem to see his way to any\nfurther step at present, and I did not think it judicious on this\noccasion to press the subject further.\nThroughout this interview, Lord Stanley's manner was candid, very\nconciliatory, and, for him, even soft. He was pleased to say that it\nwas a source of great satisfaction to him that your Royal Highness had\ndeigned to confer confidentially with me on the subject, and make me,\nas it were, a \"Mediator\" on matters which, he assured me with great\nemphasis, had occasioned him an amount of anxiety almost intolerable.\nHe had recurred, in the course of this interview, to a suggestion\nwhich he had thrown out on Tuesday, viz. that the difficulties of the\nposition might be removed, or greatly mitigated, by his retirement\nfrom the office, and accepting, if his continuance in the Government\nwas desirable, another post. I therefore thought it best at once to\npoint out to him that such a course of proceeding would only aggravate\nall the inconveniences and annoyances at present existing; that his\nretirement would be the signal for exaggerated rumours and factious\nmachinations, and would have the most baneful effect on the discussion\nin Parliament generally of all those military topics with which we\nwere threatened; that, far from being satisfactory to Her Majesty and\nyour Royal Highness, I was convinced that the Queen and yourself would\nhear of such an intention with regret.\nLord Stanley ultimately adopted entirely this view of his position,\nand he parted from me with an earnest expression of his hope that the\npainful misconceptions which had prevailed might at once, or at least\nin due course, entirely disappear.\nThis, Sir, is a very imperfect report of an important interview, but,\nas I collected from Lord Stanley, that nothing was really settled in\nhis conference on Tuesday with Lord Derby and the Lord Chancellor, I\nhave thought it my duty, without loss of time, to forward it to your\nRoyal Highness, and have the honour to remain, ever, Sir, your most\nobedient and sincerely obliged Servant,\nB.

The extraordinary exertions which France is making\nin her Naval Department oblige us to exercise the utmost vigour to\nkeep up a superiority at sea, upon which our very existence may be\nsaid to depend, and which would be already lost at any moment that\nFrance were to be joined by any other country possessing a Navy.\nThe war in India has drained us of every available Battalion.

No one else was present.\nHis Holiness, whose manner towards me was most kind and benevolent,\nsaid: \"You are appointed to succeed a very good man, for whom I\nfelt great affection, and I regret that he has left Rome. You may be\nas good as he was, and we shall become friends, but I do not know you\nyet, and Mr Lyons I had known for many years; he is going to America,\nI hear, and he will find the Americans far more difficult to deal with\nthan with us.\n\"I am much gratified to hear that the Prince of Wales is likely to\nvisit Rome, and Her Majesty, I feel sure, has done well to allow him\nto prosecute his studies here. It will be an honour to me to receive\nhim at the Vatican, and I beg that you will confer with Cardinal\nAntonelli as to the best means of making the Prince's visit here\nuseful and pleasant. We are anxious that all his wishes should be\nattended to, that he may preserve a pleasant recollection of Rome\nin the future. Alas! so many erroneous impressions exist about this\ncountry that I hope you will not judge of us too rashly. We are\nadvised to make reforms, and it is not understood that those very\nreforms, which would consist in giving this country a Government of\nlaymen, would make it cease to exist. It is called 'States of the\nChurch' (_\u00c9tats de l' \u00c9glise_), and that is what it must remain. It\nis true I have lately appointed a layman to a post formerly held by an\necclesiastic, and I may do so again occasionally; but, however small\nwe may be, we cannot yield to outer pressure, and this country must\nbe administered by men of the Church. For my part, I shall fulfil my\nduties according to my conscience, and should Governments and events\nturn against me they cannot make me yield. I shall go with the\nfaithful to the Catacombs, as did the Christians of the early\ncenturies, and there await the will of the Supreme Being, for I dread\nno human Power upon earth and fear nothing but God.\"\n\"But, Holy Father,\" I said, \"you speak as if some great danger\nthreatened Rome--is there any [real?] cause for apprehension?\"\n\"Have you not heard,\" His Holiness answered, \"that great excitement\nprevails throughout Italy?--the state of Lombardy is deplorable; evil\nspirits are at work even in my dominions, and the late speech of\nthe King of Sardinia is calculated to inflame the minds of all\nthe revolutionary men of Italy. It is true he says he will observe\nexisting Treaties, but that will scarcely counter-balance the effect\nproduced by other portions of his speech. News has also reached me of\nan extensive amnesty granted by the King of Naples--he did not yield\nto outer pressure, and he was right--but now, on the occasion of the\nmarriage of his son, an act of clemency on his part is well advised.\"\n\"Is it true,\" I said, \"that political prisoners are included in that\nAmnesty?\"\n\"Yes,\" His Holiness answered; \"I saw the name of Settembrini, and\nI think also of that other man in whom your Government took so much\ninterest--his name begins with a 'P' if I remember rightly----\"\n\"Poerio,\" I suggested.\n\"That is the name,\" the Pope continued; \"and I fancy that all the\nother political prisoners will be released; they are to be sent to\nCadiz at the expense of the King, they are to be clothed and receive\nsome money, I believe, and after that arrangements have been made\nwith the Minister of the United States to have them conveyed to that\ncountry; they are to be exiled for life. I hope this event may\nhave the effect of making your Government and that of France renew\ndiplomatic relations with Naples; I always regretted that rupture, but\nthe King was right not to yield to outer pressure.\n\"It is lucky,\" the Pope ended with a smile, \"that Lord Palmerston\nis not in office; he was too fond of interfering in the concerns of\nforeign countries, and the present crisis would just have suited\nhim. _Addio, caro_,\" the Pope then said, and dismissed me with his\nblessing.\nI then, according to usage, called on Cardinal Antonelli, and\nrecounted to him what had passed. He confirmed all the Pope had\nsaid, but denied that there was any very serious cause for immediate\napprehension of any general disturbance of the peace of Italy. I have,\netc.,\nODO RUSSELL.",

It would be removed from the direct command\nof the Crown, and entirely independent of Parliament. It would throw\nan unconstitutional amount of power and patronage into the hands of\nthe Indian Council and Government; it would be raised and maintained\nin antagonism to the Regular Army of the Crown; and professional\njealousy, and personal and private interests, would needs drive it\ninto a position of permanent hostility towards that Army.\nThis hostility has been already strongly marked in the proceedings of\nthe Commission itself.\nIts detrimental effects would not be confined to India alone, but\nwould form a most dangerous obstacle to the maintenance of the\ngovernment of the Regular Army by the Queen. Already, during\nthe Crimean War, most of the blows levelled at the Army and the\nprerogative of the Crown were directed by Indian officers, of whom,\nin future, a vast number would be at home, without employment or\nrecognised position, in compact organisation, and moved by a unity of\nfeeling.\nThere may be points of detail, admitting differences of opinion as to\nthe relative advantages of a purely local or general Military Force\nfor India; but these are mere trifles, which sink into insignificance\nin the Queen's estimation, when she has to consider the duty which she\nowes to her Crown and her Country.\nThe Queen hopes Lord Derby will not consider that she intends, by this\nletter, unduly to influence his free consideration and decision as\nto the advice he may think it his duty to offer, but merely to guard\nagainst his being taken by surprise, and to prevent, if possible, an\nunseemly public difference between herself and Lord Stanley. She is\nimpelled to the apprehension that such may arise from the manner in\nwhich, since the first transfer of the Indian Government to the Crown,\nevery act of Lord Stanley has uniformly tended to place the Queen in a\nposition which would render her helpless and powerless in resisting a\nscheme which certain persons, imbued with the old Indian traditions,\nwould appear to wish to force upon the Crown.\nThe Queen does not expect an answer to this letter from Lord Derby,\nand asks him to treat it as strictly confidential.\nThe Queen sees that Lord Stanley means to make a statement on Monday\non the Indian Finances. She trusts that there will be nothing said in\nthat statement to prejudge the Army Question.",

It would ill become Lord Derby to attempt to\nargue a question on which your Majesty has expressed so strong a\ndetermination; he has studiously avoided taking any step which might\nprejudge a question so important as the organisation of your Majesty's\nForces in India. He has awaited the report of the Commission appointed\nto enquire into the subject, and though aware of the wide difference\nof opinion which prevailed, has desired impartially to weigh and\nexamine the arguments adduced on both sides, and he has in the\nmeantime refused to give his sanction to a proposition, earnestly\npressed upon the Government by Lord Canning, for immediately raising\nadditional regiments for Indian Service. But the announcement of\nyour Majesty's determination (if he rightly understands it), under no\ncircumstances to continue an European Army in India, under terms of\nservice different from those of the Line, paid out of Indian Revenues,\nand officered by men educated for that especial service, and looking\nto India for their whole career, places Lord Derby in a position of no\nlittle embarrassment; for notwithstanding the gracious intimation that\nyour Majesty does not desire unduly to influence his judgment as to\nthe advice which he may tender, it amounts to a distinct warning\nthat if tendered in a particular direction it has no chance of being\naccepted by your Majesty. Nor, with that knowledge on his part not\nshared by his colleagues, can he freely discuss with them the course\nwhich they may consider it their duty to pursue.\nLord Derby humbly trusts, therefore, that your Majesty will be\ngraciously pleased, so far as the members of the Government are\nconcerned, to absolve him from the obligation of secrecy, and to allow\nhim to place before them a state of things which may lead to the most\nserious results, so far as their power of serving your Majesty is\nconcerned.\nLord Derby will give Lord Stanley a caution not to say anything in\nhis statement of Indian Finance which may prejudge the question of a\nsingle or separate armies; but he hardly thinks the caution necessary,\nas European troops, whether in one Service or in two, will equally be\nchargeable to the revenues of India, which will only be affected by\nthe proportion which the whole of the European may bear to the whole\nof the native forces.\nLord Derby hopes that he may be permitted to offer his humble\ncongratulations to your Majesty on the very favourable reports\nreceived from Paris by telegraph, and upon the highly satisfactory\neffects produced by your Majesty's private letter to the Emperor.\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most dutiful Servant\nand Subject,\nDERBY.",

In that case it would\nnaturally have to be differently worded, would omit every reference to\nLord Stanley, and might go more into detail.\nThe Queen cannot close this letter without correcting some\nmisapprehensions into which Lord Derby seems to have fallen. It was\nnot the Queen's intention to impute any motives of systematic action\nto Lord Stanley; she referred simply to facts and steps, known as well\nto Lord Derby as to herself, which \"uniformly tended\" to place her in\na powerless position with regard to the Army question.\nThe Queen protested against \"the _creation_ of a British Army distinct\n(in its existence and constitutional position) from that of the\nCrown,\" and not against the \"_continuance_ of an European Army, under\nterms of service different from the Line, paid out of Indian Revenues,\nand officered by men educated for that special service, and looking to\nIndia for their whole career.\" In fact, she does not understand what\nmeaning Lord Derby attaches to the words \"terms of service.\" Every\nforce kept in India, however constituted, would be paid out of Indian\nRevenues. _This_ would therefore not form the distinction, and Lord\nDerby cannot intend to convey that on these revenues one set of\nEnglishmen can have a greater claim than another; nor does she see\nwhy English officers, commanding English soldiers and charged with\nthe maintenance of _their_ discipline and efficiency, should for\nthat object require to be specially and differently educated, and be\nrestricted to look to India for their whole career.

It being my anxious desire to preserve to\nmy people the blessing of uninterrupted peace, I trust in God's\nassistance to enable me to maintain a strict and impartial\nneutrality.\"\n\"Considering, however, the present state of Europe, and the\ncomplications which a war, carried on by some of its great Powers, may\nproduce, I have deemed it necessary, for the security of my dominions\nand the honour of my Crown, to increase my Naval Forces to an amount\nexceeding that which has been sanctioned by Parliament.\"",

    "body": "Lord Derby, with his humble duty, submits to your Majesty that he has\nmost anxiously, and with every desire to meet your Majesty's wishes,\nreflected upon the effect of the alterations suggested by your\nMajesty in the proposed Speech from the Throne. He has considered\nthe consequences involved so serious that he has thought it right\nto confer upon the subject with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as\nLeader of the House of Commons; and it is a duty which he owes to your\nMajesty not to withhold the expression of their clear and unhesitating\nconviction. Lord Derby trusts that your Majesty will forgive the\nfrankness with which, in the accompanying observations, he feels it\nnecessary to submit to your Majesty the grounds for the view which\nthey are compelled to take.\nThe first paragraph to which your Majesty takes exception is that\nwhich intimates your Majesty's \"intention\" to maintain a strict and\nimpartial neutrality, and \"hope\" to be enabled to preserve peace. Your\nMajesty apprehends that this may be interpreted into a determination\nto preserve neutrality _\u00e0 tout prix_; but Lord Derby would venture to\nobserve that such an inference is negatived by the subsequent words,\nwhich only imply a \"hope\" of preserving peace. With the cessation\nof that hope, neutrality would necessarily terminate. But as matters\nstand at present, Lord Derby is warranted in assuring your Majesty\nthat if there is one subject on which more than another the mind of\nthe country is unanimous, it is that of an entire abstinence from\nparticipation in the struggle now going on in Italy. He collects this\nfrom the language of politicians of almost every class, from all the\npublic papers, from Addresses and Memorials which he receives every\nday--some urging, and some congratulating him upon the adoption of a\nperfectly neutral policy. The sympathies of the country are neither\nwith France nor with Austria, but were it not for the intervention of\nFrance, they would be general in favour of Italy. The charge now\nmade against your Majesty's servants, by the opposition Press, as the\n_Morning Post_ and _Daily News_, is that their neutrality covers\nsuch wishes and designs in favour of Austria; and any word in your\nMajesty's Speech which should imply a doubt of the continuance of\nstrict impartiality, would, undoubtedly, provoke a hostile Amendment,\nwhich might very possibly be carried in the Sardinian sense, and\nwhich, if so carried, would place your Majesty in the painful position\nof having to select an Administration, pledged against the interests\nof Austria and of Germany. Lord Derby says nothing of the personal\nresults to your Majesty's present servants, because, in such cases,\npersonal considerations ought not to be allowed to prevail; and it is\nin the interest of the country only, and even of the very cause which\nyour Majesty desires to uphold, that he earnestly trusts that your\nMajesty will not require any alteration in this part of the Speech.\nThere is, at this moment, in the country, a great jealousy and\nsuspicion of France, and of her ulterior designs--as indicated by\nthe demand of means of defence, the formation of Volunteer Corps,\netc.--but it is neutralised, partly by sympathy for Italy, partly by\nsuspicions, industriously circulated, of the pro-Austrian tendencies\nof the present Government. It is very important that the language of\nthe Speech should be so decided as to negative this impression, and\nLord Derby cannot but feel that if neutrality be spoken of not as a\nthing decided upon, but which, it is hoped, may be maintained, such\nlanguage will be taken to intimate the expectation of the Government\nthat it may, at no distant time, be departed from. In Lord Derby's\nhumble opinion Peace should be spoken of as subject to doubt, because,\nout of the present struggle, complications may arise which may\nnecessarily involve us in war; but neutrality, as between the present\nbelligerents, should be a matter open to no doubt or question. If\nthere be no attempt made to run counter to public opinion, and Austria\nshould sustain serious reverses, the jealousy of France will increase,\nand the feeling of the country will support your Majesty in a war,\nshould such arise, against her aggression; but if the slightest\npretext be afforded for doubting the _bon\u00e2 fide_ character of British\nneutrality, or the firm determination to maintain it, an anti-German\nfeeling will be excited, which will be fatal to the Administration,\nand seriously embarrassing to your Majesty.\nThe same observations apply, with hardly less force, to part of the\nAmendment suggested by your Majesty to the paragraph regarding the\nNavy. With submission to your Majesty, Lord Derby can hardly look upon\nit as humiliating to a great country, in announcing a large increase\nof its Naval Force, to disclaim any object of aggression. These words,\nhowever, might, if your Majesty were so pleased, be omitted, though\nLord Derby cannot go so far as to say that in his humble judgment the\nomission would be an improvement; but he trusts that your Majesty will\nbe satisfied with a general reference to the \"state of Europe\" without\nspeaking of the \"complications which a war carried on by some of the\nGreat Powers may produce.\" These words would infallibly lead to a\ndemand for explanation, and for a statement of the nature of the\n\"complications\" which the Government foresaw as likely to lead to war.\nIn humbly tendering to your Majesty his most earnest advice that\nyour Majesty will not insist on the proposed Amendments in his\nDraft Speech, he believes that he may assure your Majesty that he\nis expressing the unanimous opinion of his Colleagues. Of their\nsentiments your Majesty may judge by the fact that in the original\ndraft he had spoken of your Majesty's \"intention\" to preserve peace\n\"as long as it might be possible\"; but by universal concurrence these\nlatter words were struck out, and the \"hope\" was, instead of them,\nsubstituted for the \"intention.\" Should your Majesty, however, be\npleased so to order, Lord Derby will immediately submit the question\nto the consideration of his Colleagues, in order that your Majesty may\nbe put, in the most authentic form, in possession of their views.\nHe assures your Majesty that nothing can be more repugnant to his\nfeelings than to appear to offer objections to any suggestions\nemanating from your Majesty; and he has only been induced to do so\nupon the present occasion by the deep conviction which he entertains\nof the danger attending the course proposed, and the serious\nembarrassments which it would cause your Majesty. He regrets more\nespecially having been compelled to take this step at a moment when\nyour Majesty's thoughts are very differently engaged, and when it may\nbe doubly irksome to have matters of public business pressed upon your\nMajesty's consideration.\nThe above is humbly submitted by your Majesty's most dutiful Servant\nand Subject,\nDERBY.",

    "body": "The Queen has received Lord Derby's answer to her observations on the\nproposed Speech. There is in fact no difference of opinion between her\nand Lord Derby; the latter only keeps in view the effect which certain\nwords will have in Parliament and upon the country, whilst she looks\nto the effect they will produce upon the European conflict. If\nthe Queen were not obliged to speak, both positions might be well\nreconciled; but if what she is going to declare from the Throne is\nto allay suspicions purposely raised by the Opposition against the\nGovernment that they intended to take part at some moment or other in\nthe war, and is to give absolute security to the country against this\ncontingency, this will be the very thing France would wish to bring\nabout in order to ensure to her the fullest liberty in prosecuting her\nschemes for disturbing and altering the territorial state of Europe.\nHow is this impression to be avoided? Lord Derby thinks that the\nexpression of \"hope\" to be able to preserve peace to this country is\na sufficient indication that this country reserves to herself still\na certain liberty of action; but the Queen would have interpreted\nit rather as the expression of a hope, that we may not be attacked,\nparticularly when followed by the sentence in which all intention of\naggression is disclaimed, and that our armaments are merely meant for\ndefence. The sense would then appear as this: \"As the belligerents\nseparately assure me of their friendship, I am determined to maintain\na strict neutrality between them, and hope they may not change their\nminds, and attack me; I arm, but merely to defend myself if attacked.\"\nThis would abdicate on the part of this country her position as one\nof the arbiters of Europe, declare her indifference to treaties or the\nbalance of power (which are, in fact, of the greatest value to her),\nand would preclude her from any action to preserve them. The Queen\nfully enters into the Parliamentary difficulty, and would deprecate\nnothing more than to expose the Government to a defeat on an Amendment\nwhich would lead to the formation of a new Government on the principle\nof neutrality _\u00e0 tout prix_ imposed by Parliament on the Crown.\nIt will be for Lord Derby and his colleagues to consider how far they\nmay be able to avoid this danger without exposing themselves to that\npointed out by the Queen. She puts herself entirely in his hands, and\nhad suggested the verbal amendments merely with a view to indicate the\nnature of the difficulty which had struck her. Whatever decision Lord\nDerby may on further reflection come to, the Queen is prepared to\naccept.",

I respectfully assured the\nQueen that Her Majesty's commands came upon me by surprise; that at\nany time I felt my own insufficiency for such a post, and that at this\ntime there were special difficulties; that I believed the only two\npersons who could form a strong Liberal Government were either Lord\nPalmerston or Lord John Russell; and that, although it had sometimes\nhappened that two statesmen of equal pretensions preferred having a\nnominal chief to serving under one another, I did not believe that\nthis was the case now. I said that I had reason to believe that Lords\nPalmerston and John Russell were ready to co-operate with one another,\nwhile I doubted whether either would consent to serve under a younger\nman of such small pretensions as myself.\nThe Queen in reply informed me that her first thoughts had been turned\nto Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, that they had both served\nher long and faithfully, and that Her Majesty felt it to be an\ninvidious task to select one of the two. Her Majesty was also of\nopinion that as different sections of the Liberal Party were more or\nless represented by each, it might be more easy for the Party to act\ntogether under a third person. Her Majesty added that she had selected\nme as the Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords, and a\nperson in whom both Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell had been in\nthe habit of placing confidence, and she expressed her confident\nhope that their attachment to herself would induce them to yield that\nassistance without which it would be difficult to form a strong and\ncomprehensive Government.\nI proceeded to state some of the most salient difficulties of the\ntask, and asked Her Majesty's permission to ascertain by negotiation\nwhat it would be possible to do.\nHer Majesty informed me that Her Majesty's experience of former\nchanges of administration had taught her that the construction of an\nadministration had failed when the person entrusted with the task had\nacted merely as a negotiator, and that the success of other attempts\nhad been owing to the acceptance of the charge by the person for whom\nshe had sent.

Nothing could be more\nfrank and cordial than Lord Palmerston's manner.

He thinks that after having so often and so strongly\ndisapproved of the Foreign Policy of Viscount Palmerston as tending\ntoo much to involve this country in war, it would be inconsistent for\nhim to join the present Cabinet, and he also said that, at his time of\nlife and with his general habits, he does not consider himself fit for\nadministrative office.\nViscount Palmerston used every [means] in his power to induce him\nto change his decision, and showed that, with respect to present and\nfuture action, there is no apparent difference between his views and\nthose of Mr Cobden, since both would desire that this country should\nremain neutral in the war now raging in Italy. All his arguments,\nhowever, were useless, and though Mr Cobden discussed the matter in\nthe most friendly and good-humoured manner, and promised to give out\nof office all support to the Government, and said that he thought he\ncould do so more effectually out of office than in office, he could\nnot be persuaded to make any change in the answer which he came to\ngive.\nViscount Palmerston will consider what arrangement he may have to\npropose to your Majesty in consequence of Mr Cobden's answer.\nTHE MINISTRY AS FORMED BY VISCOUNT PALMERSTON.\n_in the month of June_ 1859.\n_First Lord of the Treasury_           VISCOUNT PALMERSTON.\n_Lord Chancellor_                      LORD CAMPBELL.\n_President of the Council_             EARL GRANVILLE.\n_Lord Privy Seal_                      DUKE OF ARGYLL.\n_Home Secretary_                       SIR G.

But after mature\nreflection, I think it best you should be in possession of an accurate\nand conscientious account of the sentiments of His Holiness in the\npresent important juncture of affairs.\n\"Caro mio Russell,\" the Pope said, \"you have been so long at Naples\nthat I was already thinking of sending after you to bring you back; we\ndo not like you to leave us, and the more so as I have heard you were\nattached to the Mission of Mr Elliot, who is a son of Lord Minto;\nand if he entertains the same political views as his father, he is a\ndangerous man to the peace of Italy. Now I knew Lord Minto here, and\nalthough he may be a very good man, I do not think him a man of any\ncapacity, and his doctrines were calculated to bring on the ruin of\nItaly.\"\nI replied, \"I cannot agree with your Holiness, for I consider Lord\nMinto to be a very clever man, whose honest, sound, and liberal views,\nhad they been listened to, might have prevented the crisis which is\nnow convulsing Italy.\"\nThe Pope said, \"Well, of course you belong to his party, but, _Poveri\nnoi!_ what is to become of us with your uncle and Lord Palmerston at\nthe head of affairs in England? They have always sympathised with the\nturbulent spirits of Italy, and their accession to power will greatly\nincrease the hopes of the Piedmontese Party. Indeed, I well know what\nthe English Government want: they want to see the Pope deprived of his\ntemporal power.\"\nI replied, \"Again I regret to find your Holiness so entirely mistaken\nwith respect to the policy of England. We derive great happiness from\nour free institutions, and we would be glad to see our neighbours in\nEurope as happy and as prosperous as we are, but we have no wish to\ninterfere with the internal concerns of other nations, or to give\nadvice without being asked for it; least of all as a Protestant\nPower would _we_ think of interfering one way or the other with the\nGovernment of your Holiness.\"\nThe Pope said, \"I do not doubt the good intentions of England, but\nunfortunately you do not understand this country, and your example\nis dangerous to the Italian minds, your speeches in Parliament excite\nthem, and you fancy because constitutional liberties and institutions\nsuit you, that they must suit all the world. Now the Italians are a\ndissatisfied, interfering, turbulent and intriguing race; they can\nnever learn to govern themselves, it is impossible; only see how they\nfollow Sardinia in all she tells them to do, simply because they love\nintrigue and revolution, whilst in reality they do not know what they\nwant; a hot-headed people like the Italians require a firm and just\ngovernment to guide and take care of them, and Italy might have\ncontinued tranquil and contented, had not the ambition of Sardinia led\nher to revolutionise the whole country. The Grand Duke of Tuscany,\nfor instance, is an excellent and just man, and nevertheless, at the\ninstigation of Piedmont, he was turned out of the country, and for no\nearthly purpose. I suppose you have read Monsieur About's book about\nRome? well, all he says is untrue, pure calumny, and it would be\neasy for me to have it all refuted; but he is really not worthy of\nsuch an honour. His book, I see, has been translated into English,\nand I have no doubt it will be much read and believed in England. Such\nbooks and our refugees mislead your countrymen, and I often wonder at\nthe language your statesmen hold about us in the Houses of Parliament.\nI always read their speeches. Lord Palmerston, Lord John Russell,\nand Mr Gladstone do not know us; but when I think how kindly and\nhospitably Lord Granville was received at Rome last winter, and then\nread the extraordinary speech he made last February about us, I think\nthe gout he suffered from here must have gone to his head when he\nreached England, and I wonder how Her Majesty the Queen could send\nfor him to form a Government! Then again, Mr Gladstone, who allowed\nhimself to be deceived about the Neapolitan prisoners--he does not\nknow us and Italy--and Mr Cobden,--I knew him in 1847--he is always in\nfavour of peace, and he must be very fond of animals, for when he came\nhere from Spain he wanted me to write to that country and put a stop\nto bull-fights--a very good man, but I do not know his views about\nItaly. And Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, do you think he will be\nemployed again? he seemed so anxious to get a place. Mr Disraeli was\nmy friend; I regret him. But tell me, _caro mio Russell_, if you are a\nprophet, how all this war and fuss is to end?\"\nI replied, \"Your Holiness has better claims to being a prophet than\nI have, and I sincerely hope all this may end well for Italy; but\nas regards the present and the past, I must again say that I deeply\nregret to see your Holiness misconceive the honest views and sincere\nsympathies of the statesmen you have named, for the welfare of Italy;\nthey would like to see Italy independent, prosperous, progressing and\ncontented, and able to take care of herself without foreign troops.\nYour Holiness has done me the honour to speak freely and openly with\nme; permit me to do the same, and ask your Holiness what England must\nthink when she sees the temporal power of your Holiness imposed\nupon three millions of people by the constant presence of French\nand Austrian bayonets, and when, after ten years of occupation,\nthe Austrians withdraw suddenly, there is at once an insurrection\nthroughout the country; and if the French were to leave Rome it is\ngenerally acknowledged that a revolution would compel your Holiness to\nseek refuge in some foreign country. At the same time, when the troops\nof your Holiness are employed as at Perugia, the Government is\ntoo weak to control them; they pillage and murder, and, instead\nof investigating their conduct, the excesses committed by them are\npublicly rewarded.\"\nThe Pope smiled, paused, took a pinch of snuff, and then said\ngood-humouredly: \"Although I am not a prophet, I know one thing; this\nwar will be followed by an European Congress, and a Congress about\nItalian Affairs is even worse for us than war. There will be changes\nin Italy, but mark my words, whatever these changes are, the Pope will\never be the Pope, whether he dwells in the Vatican or lives concealed\nin the Catacombs.\n\"Lastly, I will give you some advice. Prepare and take care of\nyourselves in England, for I am quite certain the French Emperor\nintends sooner or later to attack you.\"\nThe Pope then beckoned to me to approach, and making the sign of the\nCross, he gave me his blessing in Latin, then with both his hands,\nhe took one of mine, pressed it, and said with great warmth, \"Be our\nfriend in the hour of need.\" I have the honour to be, etc., etc.,\nODO RUSSELL.",

    "body": "SIR,--In the middle of last week I received at Aldenham a letter from\nMr Sidney Herbert, in which he told me that he had just received\na visit from Lord Palmerston, much perturbed and annoyed, saying that\nthe Queen had objected to all Lord John's despatches, and appeared to\nthink that it was objectionable for England to give any advice on the\nsubject of Italian affairs. Mr Herbert gave some good advice to Lord\nPalmerston, but, from the tone of his letter, I gather that he\nthought the objections made at Osborne unreasonable. I answered that\nI entirely concurred with him in the interest of everybody, that no\nfeelings of irritation should exist between the Sovereign and her\nleading Ministers; that it was possible that the Queen, forgetting\nhow very sensitive Lord John was to criticism, had pulled him up more\nsharply than he liked, but that I was convinced the objections made\nwere not exactly those mentioned by Lord Palmerston. I heard nothing\nmore till I received on Saturday evening a telegram, summoning me to a\nCabinet this day. I came to Town immediately, and saw Lord Palmerston\nyesterday. I enquired the reason of the sudden summons for a Cabinet.\nHe told me that there had been a discussion between the Queen and Lord\nJohn; that the Queen had objected to his (Lord John's) proposal that\nthe despatch of 25th July should be now communicated to the French\nGovernment. Lord John had informed him of the fact, and had requested\nhim to communicate with the Queen on the subject. Lord Palmerston\nthen read to me a well-written memorandum on the abstract question of\ngiving advice, which he had sent to Her Majesty. He told me that he\nhad been to Osborne; that the Queen had expressed a wish through Sir\nCharles Wood that he should not discuss the whole matter with her;\nthat he had had a satisfactory conversation with your Royal Highness,\nof which he gave me an abstract, which, however, contained his own\narguments at greater length than your Royal Highness's. He said that\nLord John had made a mistake with respect to the end of the despatch,\nin which Lord Cowley is desired to withhold it till after the Peace of\nZurich was concluded. Lord John gave a different interpretation to it\nfrom what appeared to be the case, as described by a previous letter\nof Lord John, in which he had said that the sentence was added at\nthe suggestion of the Cabinet, and with his entire approval. Lord\nPalmerston states that the Queen did not feel herself authorised\nto sanction a departure from what had been decided by the Cabinet,\nwithout the concurrence of the Cabinet, and that she thought it\ndesirable, if the Cabinet met, that they should agree on the future\npolicy as regards Italy. Lord John also wished for a Cabinet.\nI replied that there seemed to be a double question: first, a\ndifference between the Queen and Lord John Russell and himself; and\nsecond, the whole question of our Italian Policy. On the first point\nI could not but remember the apprehension generally felt at the\nformation of his first Government; that the feeling between the\nSovereign and himself might not be such as to give strength to the\nGovernment; that the result, however, was most satisfactory. I was not\naware of either the Queen or himself having given way on any one\npoint of principle, but the best understanding was kept up in the most\nhonourable way to both, and that, at the end of his Ministry, I knew\nthat the Queen had expressed to several persons how much she regretted\nto lose his services. That I most sincerely hoped that there was\nno chance of misunderstanding now arising; that would be most\ndisadvantageous to the Sovereign, to the public service, to the\nGovernment, and, above all, to himself. He interrupted me by assuring\nme that there was not the slightest chance of this. He repeated to\nme flattering things said by the Queen at the close of his last\nAdministration, and told me that it was impossible for the Queen to\nhave been more kind and civil than at his visit last week at Osborne.\nI continued that in Italian matters I believed the Cabinet was agreed.\nOur language to Italian Governments ought to show sympathy with Italy,\nand let them know that we were anxious that they should be left free\nto act and decide for themselves; that it should inform them in the\nclearest manner that in no case were they to obtain active assistance\nfrom us, and it ought to avoid giving any advice as to their conduct,\nwhich might make us responsible for the evil or danger which might\naccrue from following such advice. That our language to France and\nAustria ought to press upon them in every _judicious_ manner the\nexpediency of doing that which was likely to secure the permanent\nhappiness of Italy, and to persuade them to abstain from forcing upon\nthe Italians, persons and forms of Government to which they objected;\nnothing like a menace or a promise to be used....\nI then saw Sidney Herbert, who told me that Charles Wood's report\nhad entirely changed the aspect of things; that it was clear that the\nQueen had come to the assistance of the Cabinet, instead of opposing\nthem; that reason had been entirely on her side, and that Johnny had\nreduced the question now to the single point, which was not of much\nimportance, whether the 25th July despatch should now be communicated\nor not. He told me that Lord John was in a state of great irritation,\nand ready to kick over the traces. I dined at Lord Palmerston's, and\nmet Sir Charles Wood and Mr Gladstone. I had some guarded conversation\nwith the latter, who seemed very reasonable. Sir Charles Wood gave me\nall the information which I required. It appears to me that the\nreally important point is that the whole Cabinet should know the real\nquestion between the Queen and her Ministers, and that, if Lord John\ncan find plausible reasons for changing the date of the communication\nof the despatch, it may be better for the Queen to consent to this.\nSome of us will take care to have a decided opinion about the future\ncourse of our policy.\nI presume Sir George Grey will be at the Cabinet, and will be able to\nreport to your Royal Highness what has passed. If he is not there, I\nwill write again. I have the honour to be, Sir, with great respect,\nyour Royal Highness's obedient, humble, and faithful Servant,\nGRANVILLE.",

Now the question raised by the Queen\nwas _just the reverse_. The principle adopted by the Cabinet and\nsanctioned by the Queen was: not to interfere by active advice with\nthe peace to be made at Zurich; the Foreign Secretary had submitted a\ndraft which had appeared to the Queen to be in contradiction to this\nprinciple, which, upon the Sovereign's objection, he withdrew; the\nCabinet was summoned and rejected a similar draft submitted to them,\nand the Queen then complained that the very same advice should have\nbeen given by the Prime Minister in an indirect way to which the\nSovereign and Cabinet could not agree openly. Lord Palmerston's letter\nwas not communicated to the Queen until it had been alluded to in a\npublic despatch, and Count Walewski had insinuated to our Ambassador\nthat, rather than be a party to a line of conduct, which he would look\nupon as dishonourable for his master, he would resign office. What the\nQueen has asked for is: an intimation to the French Government that\nprivate communications like that of Lord Palmerston to M. de Persigny\nmust not be looked upon as the official expression of the opinion of\nHer Majesty's Government, and that we disclaim ever having intended\nto induce the Emperor to break his engagements made at Villafranca,\nwhatever they may have been.

The Queen's representative at Paris ought to be a person\nin whom she can have entire confidence, that _English_ interests alone\nwill sway his conduct. From Lord John Russell's letter it appears\nthat many of his colleagues in Cabinet saw equal objections to the\nappointment.\nThe Queen repeats her wish that her letter of yesterday may be\ncommunicated to the Cabinet.\nLord Cowley's letter, which she returns, is not calculated to\ndiminish the Queen's alarm as to the direction in which we are being\nsystematically driven, viz. _War_ to support the Emperor Napoleon,\nwho almost claims such support already as his right! He has already\nshifted his ground further, and asks for it in case Austria should\noppose \"the armed interference of Sardinia in the affairs of Central\nItaly.\" Now Sardinia can have no more right to such interference than\nAustria; yet the Emperor says \"he is quite determined to renew the\nwar in case Austria resists.\" It is under these circumstances that the\nadvice of the Prime Minister of England to the Emperor, to withdraw\nthe only impediment which restrains the action of Sardinia, becomes a\nmatter of such grave moment.\nThe Queen is determined to hold to her neutrality in the Italian\nintrigues, revolutions, and wars. It is true, Lord John says, \"it\nbecomes a great power like Great Britain to preserve the peace of\nEurope, by throwing her great weight into the scale which has justice\non its side.\" But where justice lies, admits of every variety of\nopinion.\nThe Party placed in absolute power by a revolution and a foreign\ninvasion is not necessarily the exponent of the real wishes of a\npeople, and Lord Cowley reports Mr Layard \"hot from Italy to confirm\nhim in the opinion he has always held, that the annexation of Tuscany\nto Sardinia is not practicable.\" This, however, Lord Palmerston urges,\nand if it be agreed to by the Emperor and attempted by Sardinia,\nLord John would probably wish England to fight for it as the cause of\njustice.\nHas Lord John ever contemplated the probability of Austria not being\nabandoned a second time by Germany, when attacked by France? The\nEmperor is sure to have calculated upon this, and has not played his\ngame badly, if he can get the Alliance of England to sanction and\nfoster his attack upon the Rhine, which would inevitably follow.\nThe Queen believes this to be a cherished object of France, and the\nsuccess certain if we become her dupes.

Lord John answered that he wished to know\nwhether he was to inform Her Majesty that the Cabinet were of opinion\nthat they were still respectfully of opinion that Sir James Hudson was\nthe fittest person to be named Second Plenipotentiary, or whether he\nshould acquiesce in Her Majesty's commands, reserving his own opinion\nas to the fitness of Sir James. The Chancellor answered: \"Undoubtedly\nthe second course will be the best.\" I then stated my reasons, or\nrather repeated them, for objecting to Sir James Hudson. Mr Gladstone\nmade a hesitating remark. Sir G. Lewis and the Duke of Argyll, Sir\nCharles Wood, and Sir George Grey--the latter very strongly--supported\nthe second course proposed by Lord John. Lord Palmerston spoke with\nsome temper and dogmatically as to who were right and who were wrong,\nbut advised Lord John to take the second course. The appointment of\nLord Wodehouse was proposed. Some of us do not think it a very\ngood one, but there are no sufficient grounds for our opposing it.\nI am not sure that Gladstone would not go any lengths in supporting\nLords Palmerston and John Russell on the Italian Question, although\nhe is more cautious than they are. The feeling of the rest of the\nCabinet, as far as I can judge, is perfectly sound about war, and on\nour taking an English and not a purely Sardinian attitude; but they\nare all inclined to sympathise with the national feeling in Italy, and\naverse to the restoration of the Dukes by force or by intrigue.\nLord John was sore and nervous, but talked of his letter to the Queen,\nand Lord Palmerston's to Persigny, as \"unlucky.\" Lord Palmerston seems\nconvinced that he is perfectly in the right, and everybody else in the\nwrong, and would, I am sure, take advantage of any step, taken without\nsufficient consideration by the Queen, to make a stand for his own\npolicy....\nI have the honour to be, Sir, with great respect, your Royal\nHighness's obedient and faithful Servant,\nGRANVILLE.",

Louis Napoleon wished\nfor a Congress because it would have placed a new authority between\nhimself and the Italians, whom he fears evidently concerning their\nfondness of assassinating people.

I am\nsure that England would by no means wish to have Sardinia. It will\ngive me great pleasure to hear what Lord Cowley has reported on these\nsubjects. I understand that Louis Napoleon is now much occupied with\nGermany, and studies its resources. This is somewhat alarming, as he\nhad followed, it seems, the same course about Italy. _Gare la bombe_,\nthe Prussians may say. One cannot understand why Louis Napoleon is\nusing so many odd subterfuges when plain acting would from the month\nof September have settled everything. I must say that I found Walewski\nat that time very sensible and conservative. His retiring will\ngive the impression that things are now to be carried on in a less\nconservative way, and people will be much alarmed.

    "body": "MY LORD,--It is with extreme regret that I call your Lordship's\nattention to the following occurrence.\nThere was a concert last night at the Tuileries, to which the Chiefs\nof the Diplomatic Body were invited. On these occasions seats are\nassigned to the Ambassadors according to their accidental rank, and\nI was placed between the Nuntio and the Russian Ambassador. It is\ncustomary for the Emperor, during the interval between the two\nparts of the concert, to say a few words to each of the Ambassadors\nindividually, and it is obvious that what His Majesty says to one may\neasily be overheard by that one's immediate neighbours.\nYesterday evening the Emperor, after saying a few words of no\nimportance to the Nuntio, addressed himself to me in a manner and\ntone very unusual with him, animadverting upon the hostile sentiments\nevinced towards him in the English Parliament and Press. \"Wishing\nto avoid a discussion, I merely observed that I regretted that matters\nshould be in such a state, but that His Majesty must be aware that\nthere was quite as great irritation on this side the water. The\nEmperor enquired sharply whether this was to be wondered at,\nconsidering the terms and imputations applied to himself, and to the\nFrench nation, in England? They were only defending themselves against\nunfair attacks, His Majesty said. It was really too bad, he continued;\nhe had done all in his power to maintain a good understanding with\nEngland, but the conduct of England rendered it impossible. What had\nEngland to do with Savoy? And why was she not to be satisfied with the\ndeclaration that His Majesty had made to me, that he had no intention\nto annex Savoy to France without having previously obtained the\nconsent of the Great Powers.\n\"Pardon me, Sire,\" I said, \"for interrupting your Majesty, but it\nis just what you did not say. Had you permitted me to convey that\nassurance to Her Majesty's Government, I will answer for it that all\nthose interpellations in Parliament would long since have ceased, and\nthat Her Majesty's Government and the country would at all events have\nawaited the decision at which the Great Powers might have arrived.\"\n\"But I told you,\" continued the Emperor, \"that I would consult the\nGreat Powers.\"\n\"Yes, Sire,\" I replied, \"but your Majesty did not add that you would\nabide by their decision.\"\nThis conversation had taken place, not only within the hearing of the\nRussian Ambassador, but the Emperor's remarks were addressed almost\nas much to my colleague as to myself. Turning then entirely towards\nGeneral Kisseleff, the Emperor continued: \"The conduct of England is\ninexplicable. I have done all in my power to keep on the best terms\nwith her; but I am at my wits' end _(je n'en puis plus)._ What,\" His\nMajesty exclaimed again, \"has England to do with Savoy? What would\nhave been the consequence if, when she took possession of the Island\nof Perim for the safety of her Eastern dominions, I had raised the\nsame objections that she has now raised to the annexation of Savoy,\nwhich I want as much for the safety of France?\"\nHis Majesty continued to speak for a few seconds in the same strain,\nand I felt my position to be most awkward. With the remembrance of\nHis Majesty's intemperate words to M. de H\u00fcbner on New Year's Day,\n1859, in my mind, I did not like to leave unnoticed observations\nof the tendency I have mentioned. At the same time I had to bear in\nmind that I was not present on an official occasion, but that I was\nthe Emperor's guest, and that it would not be right to continue a\ndiscussion in the presence of others. These thoughts passed rapidly\nthrough my mind, and I determined to be guided by a night's reflection\nin taking any further step in this matter. What that reflection might\nhave produced I cannot say, but circumstances led to more immediate\nexplanations.\nAs the Emperor moved on, the circle in which we were standing was\nnot strictly kept, and after a few minutes I found myself standing a\nlittle in front, in the open space round which the circle was formed.\nThe Emperor again accosted me, and was beginning in the same strain,\nwhen I ventured to interrupt His Majesty and to tell him that I\nconsidered myself justified in calling his attention to the unusual\ncourse he had adopted, in indulging, in presence of the Russian\nAmbassador, in his animadversions on the conduct of England. That His\nMajesty, if he had, or thought he had, any cause for remonstrance or\nblame with regard to England, should address himself to me, was not\nonly natural, but would be a course which I should always beg him to\ntake, because free discussion was the best remedy for pent-up feeling.\nI should answer as best I could, and endeavour to convince His Majesty\nwhen I thought him wrong. Or if His Majesty considered it right to\ncomplain of the conduct of England to the Russian Ambassador, I had no\ndesire to interfere, provided it was not done in my presence; but what\nI could not approve, or consider compatible with my own dignity,\nor that of the Government which I represented, was that complaints\nrespecting England should be addressed to me in the hearing of the\nRussian Ambassador, and to the Russian Ambassador in my hearing.\nLeaving then this official tone, I added that, considering the long\nand intimate relations which His Majesty had been graciously pleased\nto permit should exist between himself and me, and knowing, as he did,\nthe personal attachment which I bore him, and the anxiety which I had\never manifested to smooth difficulties and prevent misunderstandings\nbetween the two Governments, in doing which I had perhaps exposed\nmyself to the suspicion of being more French than I ought to be, I had\nnot expected to have been addressed, as I had been, in the presence\nof the Russian Ambassador, or to have heard words addressed to that\nAmbassador complaining of the sentiments of the English nation.\nThe Emperor frequently interrupted me, expressing his great regret at\nwhat had occurred. He could assure me, His Majesty said, that he\nhad spoken without any bad intention--that he had just read what had\noccurred in Parliament the night before, and that he had been greatly\nhurt at the strictures passed upon his conduct; I must recollect\nfurther that he had not spoken of the Government, but of those who\nattacked him. Again, His Majesty begged me to think no more of the\nmatter, repeating the assurance that he had spoken without intention.\nIn the course of this second conversation the Emperor again asked,\nbut in a very different tone, why England had taken up the question of\nSavoy which so little regarded her. Had it been Prussia or one of the\nContinental Powers, His Majesty could have understood it, but not a\nword of remonstrance had proceeded from any one of them. I replied\nthat I did not think the Emperor could rely on that silence as\nindicating approbation, but at all events, I said, the position of Her\nMajesty's Government was very different from that of the other powers.\nHow was it possible, I asked, for Her Majesty's Government to remain\nsilent in presence of the interpellations respecting Savoy which were,\nnight after night, put to them? And if His Majesty enquired why these\ninterpellations were put, I would answer him that, if my judgment was\ncorrect, it was not so much on account of the actual plan of annexing\nSavoy, as on account of the circumstances connected with the whole\ntransaction. They were, in fact, interpellations of mistrust. And how,\nI asked, could it be otherwise? What could the English people think\non its transpiring that in spite of His Majesty's declarations,\nboth before and during the war, that in going to war he meditated\nno special advantages for France, overtures had positively been made\nmonths before, to Sardinia, for the eventual cession of Savoy; why had\nnot His Majesty told us fairly, in commencing this war, that if, by\nthe results of the war, the territory of Sardinia should be greatly\naugmented, he might be obliged, in deference to public opinion in\nFrance, to ask for some territorial advantage? Such a declaration,\nalthough it might have rendered the British Government still more\nanxious to prevent the war, would have hindered all the manifestation\nof public opinion which is now taking place.\nThe Emperor seemed to feel the weight of these observations, and\nhe ended the conversation by saying, that if this question of Savoy\nshould go further, he had pledged himself to consult the Great\nPowers, and that he need hardly add that if their opinion should be\nunfavourable to his wishes, it would have great weight with him.\n\"It is not likely,\" said His Majesty, \"that I should act against the\nadvice of Europe.\"\nI end, my Lord, as I commenced, in regretting this occurrence. I\ncould have wished that the Emperor had not spoken to me a second time\nyesterday, and that I had had a little time for reflection. I feel\nthat I spoke to His Majesty under considerable emotion, caused by the\ntone and manner which he had adopted; but I am certain that not a word\nescaped me which was not respectful to himself. To have passed the\nmatter over, would, in my judgment, have been a fault, but on the\nwhole I should have preferred conveying impressions to His Majesty\nthrough M. Thouvenel. I earnestly trust, however, that Her Majesty's\nGovernment will view my conduct in a favourable light.\nIt is but justice to my Russian colleague to state that nothing could\nhave been in better taste than his remarks in answer to the Emperor's\nobservations to him. I have told General Kisseleff this morning that\nhaving had an opportunity to do so, I had expressed to the Emperor\nthe opinion that it would have been better had His Majesty avoided\nirritating topics concerning England in the presence of another\nforeign representative. It is not my intention to open my lips on the\nsubject to any one else.\nCOWLEY.",

    "body": "Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and begs\nto state that the Cabinet met to-day at half-past twelve to consider\nwhat (if anything) should be done in consequence of the vote of the\nHouse of Lords last night. Lord John Russell, Mr Gladstone, and Mr\nMilner Gibson were desirous of finding some means of visiting their\ndispleasure upon the House of Lords, but it was shown to them that\nthe only measures which could be adopted were far too violent for the\noccasion, and that the House of Commons itself is powerless in the\nmatter. When the Lords do anything inconsistent with the asserted\nprivileges of the House of Commons, as, for instance, inserting a\ntaxing Clause in a Bill sent up to them, or making an alteration in\na Money Bill sent up to them, the House of Commons is necessarily\ninvited to do something afterwards in the matter, by assenting to what\nhas been done by the Lords; and the Commons then assert their claimed\nrights by throwing out the Bill thus, improperly, as the Commons say,\nmeddled with by the Lords; but when the Lords throw out a Bill there\nis nothing for the Commons to do, as the Bill has vanished, and the\nCommons are therefore furnished with no opportunity of asserting the\nright which they may claim. But, moreover, the Commons have always\ncontended that the Lords cannot originate or alter a Money Bill, but\nit has never been contended that the Lords may not reject a Money\nBill, though there are few instances of their having done so. These\narguments at length prevailed, and by four o'clock it was agreed that\nViscount Palmerston should give notice that he would on Thursday move\nthat a Committee be appointed to examine the Journals of the House\nof Lords to ascertain the fate of the Bill thus lost like Sir John\nFranklin, and that on Friday he should move the appointment of a\nCommittee to search for precedent applicable to the case. This course\nit was thought, while binding the Government to no particular course,\nwould in some degree satisfy those who think some step necessary. The\nmeasures mentioned, though it is fair to say not actually proposed,\nwere that Parliament should be prorogued, and reassembled either in\nthe Autumn or Winter, that then the same Bill should be brought\nin, and be sent up to the Lords, and that if that Bill were again\nrejected, Parliament should be dissolved. It was objected to all this,\nthat the case did not warrant such a course; that whether the Lords\nhave or have not overstepped their proper functions, the opinion of\nthe great majority of the public is that the Lords have done a right\nand useful thing (in confirmation of which it may be stated that the\npeople in the gallery of the House of Lords are said to have joined\nin the cheers which broke out when the numbers of the division were\nannounced).\nViscount Palmerston, at the meeting of the House, gave notice\naccordingly that he should on Thursday move for a Committee to search\nthe Lords' Journals--a usual form of motion; and that he should on\nFriday move to appoint a Committee to search for precedents in order\nto ascertain facts; but he added that he did not take this course with\nany view of hostility towards the House of Lords. An attempt was made\nby Mr Whalley and Mr Digby Seymour to set up a complaint that this was\nnot the sort of proceeding which the gravity of the occasion required,\nbut this endeavour was put down by an unmistakable manifestation of a\ncontrary opinion by the rest of the House....",

The material question for\ndiscussion was the course to be pursued about the Tax Bill Report.\nLord John Russell had altered his opinion since Saturday, and had\nyesterday sent Viscount Palmerston a Draft of Resolution which he\nwished to be circulated to the members of the Cabinet before their\nmeeting at twelve to-day....\nAfter a long discussion, the draft, of which the enclosed is a copy,\nwas agreed to by all except Mr Gladstone. This draft is a combination\nof parts of Lord John's, parts of Sir James Graham's, and parts of\nViscount Palmerston's. No mention of course was made in Cabinet of Sir\nJames Graham having made any suggestion.\nWhen all the other members had left the room Mr Gladstone requested\nViscount Palmerston to submit to your Majesty that he could no longer\ncontinue to carry on the business of his Department. His opinion\nstrongly was that action and not a Resolution was required, that\none of three courses ought to be pursued: either that the Paper Duty\nRepeal Bill should again be sent up to the Lords; or that a Bill\nshould be sent up for suspending the Paper Duties for a year; or that\na Bill should be sent up reducing those duties gradually year by year;\nor fourthly that with the Repeal of the Paper Duties should be coupled\nthe imposition of Spirit Duties. Viscount Palmerston said he really\ncould not undertake the communication which Mr Gladstone wished to\nbe submitted to your Majesty, and earnestly entreated Mr Gladstone to\nreconsider the matter; he urged in detail all the reasons which ought\nto dissuade such a step, and he thought that he had produced some\nimpression on Mr Gladstone. It was agreed between them that Viscount\nPalmerston, instead of giving notice this afternoon of a Motion\nto-morrow, and laying the Resolution on the table this evening, should\ngive notice this afternoon of a Motion for Thursday, and promise to\nlay the Resolution on the table to-morrow. This gives Mr Gladstone\nmore time to think, and more room to turn round in. Mr Milner Gibson\nhas no intention of going out, and has so told Mr Gladstone, strongly\nadvising him to stay in; and Viscount Palmerston's impression is\nthat Mr Gladstone, having failed to become master of the Cabinet by a\nthreat of resignation, will in the end yield to the almost unanimous\ndecision of his colleagues. The only person who supported Mr\nGladstone's views, except Mr Milner Gibson, was the Duke of\nArgyll, who, however, like Mr Gibson, had no intention whatever of\naccompanying Mr Gladstone in resignation....",

I hope you will see the young and very nice Empress of\nAustria, perhaps you made a little excursion to Plymouth. I had,\nand have still, some cold, and therefore I was apprehensive of waiting\nat the station on the 20th in the evening; I sent Marie and Philip\nto receive the Empress. Yesterday before daybreak I went myself to\nAntwerp. I first paid the Empress a visit, and then I took her to your\nbeautiful ship. She was much struck with it, and it was _very kind_\nof you, and indeed, for an invalid, invaluable. It will show,\nbesides, that even beyond Garibaldi, and that amiable, disinterested\n_Annex_ander, you can feel some interest. I saw the Empress already\ndressed for her departure, but I think there is something very\npeculiar about her, which is very pleasing. Poor soul, to see her go\naway under, I fear, not very safe circumstances, as she coughs a great\ndeal, quite grieves one; though it certainly increased my stupid cold,\nstill I should have been sorry not to have assisted at her going to\nsea. It was a beautiful day, but this night it has begun to blow from\nthe West-south-west, which I fear will create a sea to the Westward.\nThat you had your sons about you must have been a great satisfaction\nto you. Bertie got well through his truly tremendous tour. I think\nthat the effect on the Americans will last for some time. That the\npoor Duke of Newcastle got home without accident is surprising. Affy\nhas something most winning, and is a dear little rogue. Eug\u00e9nie's\nexpedition is most astonishing. She also coughs much, and I never\nheard Scotland recommended for Winter excursions. I believe that the\ndeath of her sister affected her a good deal. She seems to have been a\ngood deal _choqu\u00e9e_ that she had been dancing in Africa when that poor\nsister was dying. Next to this, there seems a difference of opinion\nwith her master on the subject of the Pope. You will recollect that\nat the time of his elections the clergy rendered him undoubted good\nservice; I even doubt that he would have been elected without their\naid. Now he puts the axe to the root of the whole Catholic Church\nby destroying the Pope, and he does this _without the slightest\nprovocation_, and for the benefit of the revolution _et des\nr\u00e9volutionnaires_....\nI remain ever, my beloved Victoria, your devoted Uncle,\nLEOPOLD R.",

For\nthese purposes it is desirable that a bishop should have practical\nknowledge of parochial functions, and should not be of an overbearing\nand intolerant temperament. His diocesan duties are enough to occupy\nall his time, and the less he engages in theological disputes the\nbetter. Much mischief has been done by theological bishops, and if the\nBench were filled with men like the Bishops of Oxford and Exeter there\nwould be no religious peace in the land. Nor have men chosen merely\nfor their learning succeeded better; Thirlwall, Bishop of St David's,\nand Blomfield, the late Bishop of London, were chosen on account of\ntheir learning; the former is acknowledged to be inefficient, the\nlatter greatly mismanaged his diocese. The theological learning of\nthe Bishop of Exeter has caused much mischief to the Established\nChurch. Viscount Palmerston would also beg to submit that the\nintolerant maxims of the High Church bishops have exasperated the\nDissenters who form a large portion of the nation, and have given\noffence to many good Churchmen. The Bishop of Exeter, the late Bishop\nof Carlisle, and the late Bishop of Rochester, the two latter\nindividuals kind-hearted and good-natured men, refused to consecrate\nburial grounds unless a wall of separation divided the portion\nallotted to Churchmen from the portion allotted to Dissenters--a\ndemand which gave offence to both communities. Viscount Palmerston\nwould beg to submit that several of the bishops whom he has had the\nhonour of recommending to your Majesty had distinguished themselves by\ntheir classical and academical attainments, and he may mention in this\nrespect the names of Baring, Longley, Tait, Wigram, and Waldegrave.\nViscount Palmerston can assure your Majesty that although his\nselection of bishops has been much found fault with by the High\nChurch, Puseyite, and semi-Catholic Party, they have given great\nsatisfaction to the nation at large, and Viscount Palmerston has\nreceived communications to that effect, verbal and written, from\npersons of all classes, and political parties in all parts of the\ncountry. The people of this country are essentially Protestant, they\nfeel the deepest aversion to Catholicism, and they see that the High\nChurch, Tractarian, and Puseyite doctrines lead men to the Church of\nRome. The disgraceful scenes last year at St George's in the East\nwere only an exaggerated outburst of a very general and deeply-rooted\nfeeling. Viscount Palmerston believes that the clergy of the\nEstablished Church were never more exemplary in the performance of\ntheir duties, more respected by the Laity and, generally speaking, on\nbetter terms with the Nonconformist body than at the present time.",

There seems to be no\ndoubt that there were many scenes, partly about the Pope, and also on\naccount of her sister's funeral; she was so angry with Fould about it\nthat she insisted on his dismissal. Then the Priests are said to\ntry and work upon her, and say that her son will die if the Emperor\ncontinues _dans cette voie_ against the Pope.\nWe saw Mr Elliot from Naples yesterday, who has always been very\nfair. He says that _if_, when the King came to the Throne, he had\n_only_ insisted on the laws of the country being properly carried\nout, _no_ reforms or change in the Constitution would have been\nnecessary--but from the want of energy, and also no strength of\nintellect and great indecision of character of the poor King, as well\nas an unfortunate _Piet\u00e4t_ for the memory of his father, nothing right\nwas done; bad counsellors surrounded him, the Queen Mother had a bad\ninfluence, and finally everything was given up as lost--when it might\nyet have been prevented. They dislike extremely being annexed, but\nprefer it to having back the former state of things.\nWe have since ten or twelve days almost incessant rain, so that we\nshall soon be on an island.

She came at\nhalf-past one, and stayed till a little after three. She looked very\npretty, but very sad--and in speaking of her health and of her return\nfrom Algiers began to cry. She seems to be much better, however, for\nher journey; before she could neither eat nor sleep, nor would she\ntake notice of anything. She never mentioned the Emperor but once when\nshe offered his compliments, and there was not the slightest allusion\nto politics. It is altogether very strange. She remains another week\nin England, and then goes back as she came. I gave her your message,\nand she enquired after you. Ever your devoted Niece,\nVICTORIA R.",

The capture of Pekin in Asia by British and French\ntroops; the Union in Europe of nearly the whole of Italy into one\nMonarchy; and the approaching and virtually accomplished Dissolution\nin America of the great Northern Confederation, are events full\nof importance for the future, as well as being remarkable in time\npresent.\nViscount Palmerston submits two letters which your Majesty may feel an\ninterest in seeing. With regard to that from Lord John Russell stating\na half-formed wish to go to the House of Lords, Viscount Palmerston\ndoes not expect that the desire will be repeated when the Session\nbegins, although Lord John said last year that he felt attendance in\nthe House of Commons in addition to the labour of his office, more\nthan he could well get through. He would be a loss to Viscount\nPalmerston in the House of Commons, especially after the removal of Mr\nSidney Herbert to the House of Lords; and speaking confidentially\nto your Majesty with regard to the future, Viscount Palmerston would\nthink himself doing better service by recommending the House of Lords\nfor Mr Gladstone, than for Lord John Russell.\nMr Herbert will take the title of Lord Herbert of Lea, the title of\nHerbert being that borne by his elder brother during the life of the\nlate Lord Pembroke.\nThe other letter from Lord Malmesbury relates to a communication\nwhich he made to Viscount Palmerston last year from Lord Derby and Mr\nDisraeli at the beginning of the Session, to the effect that, if\nthe Government were then to break up from internal dissensions, the\nConservative Party would support during the then ensuing Session any\nadministration which Viscount Palmerston might be able provisionally\nto make, to carry through the business of the Session. Viscount\nPalmerston is not aware of any circumstances which can have led to the\nexpectation that the present administration is likely to be broken up\nby internal divisions in the course of this next Session. There are\nno questions ahead so likely to produce discord as the Reform Bill of\nlast year, and the differences between the two Houses about the Paper\nDuties, about which it was very difficult to prevent Lord John and Mr\nGladstone from flying off, or the Fortification Question, upon which\nMr Gladstone announced to his colleagues, nearly a dozen times, that\nhe was firmly resolved to resign. Viscount Palmerston has asked Lord\nMalmesbury to come over to him to Broadlands at any time before the\n21st or 22nd of this month, which is the probable time at which the\nCabinet will have to meet in London.\nViscount Palmerston finds he has not got Lord John Russell's letter\nat hand, but the only thing of any interest in it was the intimation\nwhich Viscount Palmerston quoted.",

    "body": "BELOVED PARENTS,--At last I can find a moment for myself to sit down\nand collect my thoughts and to write to you an account of these two\nlast dreadful days! My head is in such a state, I do not know where\nI am hardly--whether I am in a dream or awake, what is yesterday and\nwhat to-day! What we have so long expected is come at last! All the\nconfusion, bustle, excitement, noise, etc., is all swallowed up in\nthat one thought for me--I have seen death for the first time! It has\nmade an impression upon me that I shall never, never forget as long\nas I live--and I feel so ill, so confused and upset by all that I have\ngone through in the last forty-eight hours, that you must forgive\nme if I write incoherently and unclearly. But to go back to Monday\nevening (it seems to me a year now). At a quarter to eight in the\nevening of Monday the 31st, I took dear darling Affie to the railway\nstation, and took leave of him with a heavy heart. You know I love\nthat dear boy distractedly, and that nothing could have given me more\npleasure than his dear, long-wished-for visit. At nine o'clock Fritz\nand I went to tea at the Prince Regent's; we four were alone together.\nThe Princess was rather low and unwell, the Prince low-spirited, and\nI thinking of nothing but Affie and of how dear he is. While we were\nsitting at tea we received bad news from Sans Souci, but nothing\nto make us particularly uneasy. Fritz and I went home and to bed, not\nbeing in a humour to sit up till twelve.\nAbout half-past one we heard a knock at the door and my wardrobe maid\nbrought in a telegram saying the King was given up, and a note from\nthe Prince Regent saying he was going up immediately. We got up in the\ngreatest hurry and dressed--I hardly know how; I put on just what\nI found, and had not time to do my hair or anything. After we had\nhurried on our clothes we went downstairs and out--for there was no\ntime to get a carriage or a footman or anything--it was a splendid\nnight, but twelve degrees of cold (R\u00e9aumur). I thought I was in a\ndream finding myself alone in the street with Fritz at two o'clock\nat night. We went to the Prince Regent's, and then with them in their\ncarriages to the railway station--we four all alone in the train. We\narrived at Sans Souci and went directly into the room where the King\nlay--the stillness of death was in the room--only the light of the\nfire and of a dim lamp. We approached the bed and stood there at the\nfoot of it, not daring to look at one another or to say a word. The\nQueen was sitting in an armchair at the head of the bed, her arm\nunderneath the King's head, and her head on the same pillow on which\nhe lay; with her other hand she continually wiped the perspiration\nfrom his forehead. You might have heard a pin drop; no sound was heard\nbut the crackling of the fire and the _death-rattle_, that dreadful\nsound which goes to one's heart, and which tells plainly that life is\nebbing. This rattling in the throat lasted about an hour longer, and\nthen the King lay motionless. The doctors bent their heads low to hear\nwhether he still breathed--and we stood, not even daring to sit down,\nwatching the death-struggle; every now and then the King breathed very\nfast and loud, but never unclosed his eyes; he was very red in the\nface, and the cold perspiration pouring from his forehead. I never\nspent such an awful time! And to see the poor Queen sitting there\nquite rent my heart--three, four, five, six, seven struck, and we were\nstill standing there--one member of the family came in after the other\nand remained motionless in the room, sobs only breaking the silence.\nOh! it is dreadful to see a person die! All the thoughts and feelings\nthat crowded on my mind in those hours I cannot describe, more than in\nmy whole past lifetime. The light of the morning dawned, and the lamps\nwere taken away--oh, how sad for the first morning in the year! We\nall went into the next room, for I assure you, anxiety, watching,\nstanding, and crying had worn us out. The Princess fell asleep on a\nchair, I on a sofa, and the rest walked up and down the room asking\none another, How long will it last? Towards the middle of the day,\nMarianne and I went into the room alone, as we wished to stay there;\nwe came up and kissed the Queen's hand and knelt down and kissed the\nKing's; it was quite warm still. We stood about and waited till five\no'clock and then had some dinner, and I felt so sick and faint and\nunwell, that Fritz sent me here to bed. At one o'clock this morning I\ngot up and dressed, and heard that the King had not many minutes more\nto live, but by the time I had got the carriage I heard all was over.\nI drove to Sans Souci and saw the King and Queen. May God bless and\npreserve them, and may theirs be a long and happy and blessed reign.\nThen I went into the room where the King lay, and I could hardly bring\nmyself to go away again. There was so much of comfort in looking\nat that quiet, peaceful form, at rest at last after all he had\nsuffered--gone home at last from this world of suffering--so peaceful\nand quiet he looked, like a sleeping child. Every moment I expected to\nsee him move or breathe--his mouth and eyes closed, and such a sweet\nand happy expression--both his hands were on the coverlid. I kissed\nthem both for the last time; they were quite cold then. Fritz and I\nstood looking at him for some time. I could hardly bring myself\nto believe that this was really death, that which I had so often\nshuddered at and felt afraid of; there was nothing there dreadful or\nappalling, only a heavenly calm and peace. I felt it did me so much\ngood, and was such a comfort. \"Death, where is thy sting? Grave,\nwhere is thy victory?\" He was a just and good man, and had a heart\noverflowing with love and kindness, and he has gone to his rest after\na long trial which he bore with so much patience. I am not afraid of\ndeath now, and when I feel inclined to be so, I shall think of that\nsolemn and comforting sight, and that death is only a change for the\nbetter. We went home and to bed and this morning went there at ten.\nI sat some time with the poor Queen, who is so calm and resigned and\ntouching in her grief. She does not cry, but she looks heartbroken.\nShe said to me: \"I am not longer of any use in this world. I have no\nlonger any vocation, any duties to perform. I only lived for him.\"\nThen she was so kind to me, kinder than she has ever been yet, and\nsaid I was like her own child and a comfort to her. I saw the corpse\nagain this morning; he is unaltered, only changed in colour, and the\nhands are stiffened.\nThe funeral will be on Saturday; the King will lie in state till then.\nHis wish was to be buried in Friedenskirche before the altar--and his\nheart at Charlottenburg in the Mausoleum. Of course all will be done\nthat he wishes. His servants are in a dreadful state. They adored him,\nand nursed him day and night for three years with the most devoted\nattachment. The King and Queen stay at Sans Souci till after the\nfuneral, and Fritz and I here at Potsdam.... Ever your most dutiful\nand devoted Daughter,\nVICTORIA.\n_P.S._--The funeral will only take place on Monday, and the body will\nbe embalmed to-morrow. To-morrow evening there will be prayers at the\nbedside, and the day after the lying in state.",

Viscount Palmerston\nstill retains that opinion; because a separate kingdom of the Two\nSicilies would be more likely, in the event of war between England and\nFrance, to side, at least by its neutrality, with the strongest Naval\nPower, and it is to be hoped that such Power would be England. But\nthen it would be necessary that the Two Sicilies as an independent and\nseparate State should be well governed, and should have an enlightened\nSovereign. This unfortunately has become hopeless and impossible under\nthe Bourbon Dynasty, and no Englishman could wish to see a Murat or a\nPrince Napoleon on the Throne of Naples. The course of events\nsince last summer seems to have finally decided the fate of Sicily and\nNaples, and there can be no doubt that for the interest of the people\nof Italy, and with a view to the general balance of Power in Europe,\na united Italy is the best arrangement. The Italian Kingdom will never\nside with France from partiality to France, and the stronger that\nkingdom becomes the better able it will be to resist political\ncoercion from France. The chief hold that France will have upon the\npolicy of the Kingdom of Italy consists in the retention of Venetia by\nAustria.\nViscount Palmerston has heard no more from Lord John Russell about his\nwish eventually to go to the House of Lords, and it is probable that\nthis wish often before expressed will, as upon former occasions, be\nallowed to sleep undisturbed....",

I have had no answer as yet, and the election is\nfixed for to-morrow.\nThe election is on the same footing as that of a bishop who is\nnominally elected by the Chapter of the Diocese, but who is named for\nbeing so elected by the Crown. The Crown recommends the person to be\nnamed Provost, and the Fellows as a matter of course elect him. But\nthe election must be made within a stated period--I believe fifteen\ndays after the vacancy has happened; and if the Crown does not within\nthat period recommend, the Fellows proceed to make their own choice.\nThe election is fixed for to-morrow, and it would not, I think, be\ndesirable to let the Royal prerogative drop on this occasion. The\npersons who have been named as candidates are Dr Goodford, Headmaster,\nand with regard to him it is to be said that the office has generally\nbeen given to the Headmaster, and that, as far as the Provost has any\nfunction connected with improvements in the arrangement of the school,\nthere is an advantage in his having been conversant with the details\nof the existing system. Dr Goodford is qualified for the office by his\ndegree.\nThe next candidate is Mr Coleridge, once a master in the school, but\nhe is not qualified by a sufficient degree, and there was a prejudice\nagainst him on account of his Puseyite tendencies.\nThe third is Dr Chapman, late Bishop of Colombo, qualified by his\ndegree, but having no peculiar claims or other recommendations for the\noffice.\nThe fourth is Mr Birch, formerly tutor to the Prince of Wales,\nscarcely of sufficient calibre for the office, and not qualified by a\nsufficient degree.\nBetween Dr Goodford and Dr Chapman I think the preference should be\ngiven to Dr Goodford, and the more especially because Dr Chapman is\nsupposed to entertain theological opinions similar to those of Mr\nColeridge, his brother-in-law.\nIf the Queen should approve of Dr Goodford being recommended,\nperhaps she would have the goodness to sign the document sent in the\naccompanying box, and if it is returned by the earliest opportunity it\nis just possible that I may be able to send it to Windsor in time for\nthe election to-morrow.

On Sunday I took leave of those dearly beloved remains--a\ndreadful moment; I had never been near a coffin before, but dreadful\nand heartrending as it was, it was so beautifully arranged that it\nwould have pleased _her_, and most probably _she_ looked down and\nblessed _us_--as we poor sorrowing mortals knelt around, overwhelmed\nwith grief! It was covered with wreaths, and the carpet strewed\nwith sweet, white flowers. _I_ and our daughters did _not_ go\n_yesterday_--it would have been _far_ too much for _me_--and Albert\nwhen he returned, with tearful eyes told me it was well I did not\ngo--so affecting had been the sight--so _universal_ the sympathy.\nPoor little Arthur went too. I and my girls prayed at home together,\nand dwelt on her happiness and peace.\nBut oh! dearest Uncle--the loss--the truth of it--which _I cannot, do\nnot_ realise even when I go (as I do _daily_) to Frogmore--the _blank_\nbecomes _daily_ worse!\nThe constant intercourse of _forty-one_, years cannot cease without\nthe _total want_ of _power_ of _real enjoyment_ of _anything_. A sort\nof cloud which hangs over you, and seems to _oppress_ everything--and\na positive _weakness_ in the powers of reflection and mental exertion.\nThe doctors _tell_ me I _must not_ attempt to _force_ this. Long\nconversation, loud talking, the talking of many people together, I\n_can't_ bear yet. It must come _very_ gradually....\nI try to be, and very often am, quite _resigned_--but dearest Uncle,\nthis is a life sorrow. On _all_ festive or mournful occasions, on\n_all_ family events, _her love_ and _sympathy_ will be so _fearfully\nwanting_. Then again, except Albert (who I very often don't see but\nvery little in the day), I have _no human_ being except our children,\nand that is not the same _Verh\u00e4ltniss_, to _open_ myself to; and\nbesides, a _woman_ requires _woman's_ society and sympathy sometimes,\nas men do _men's_. All this, beloved Uncle, will show you that,\nwithout _dwelling_ constantly upon it, or _moping_ or becoming\n_morbid_, though the _blank_ and the _loss to me_, in my isolated\nposition especially, is _such_ a _dreadful_, and such an _irreparable\none_, the worst _trials_ are _yet_ to come. My poor birthday, I\ncan hardly think of it! Strange it is how often _little trifles_,\ninsignificant in themselves, upset one more even than greater\nthings....\nBut the general sympathy for _me_, and approval of the manner in\nwhich I have shown my grief, as well as the affection and respect for\ndearest Mamma's memory in the country, is _quite wonderful and most\ntouching_.

His tenure of office\nat that time was short; not from any fault of his, but because the\nGovernment of that day was overthrown by Viscount Palmerston's Motion\nin the House of Commons in February 1852 about the Militia; and Lord\nGranville speaks highly of Mr Layard's performance of his official\nduties at that time. There is no reason, but the reverse, for thinking\nhim less competent now than then; and an Under-Secretary of State is\nonly the instrument and mouthpiece of his principal to say what he is\ntold, and to write what he is bid.\nWith regard to Mr Layard's position in the House of Commons, he would\nin no respect be the representative of the Foreign Policy of the\ncountry; that function will belong to Viscount Palmerston, now that\nthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will be removed to the\nHouse of Lords, and it will be Viscount Palmerston's duty and care\nto see that nobody infringes upon that function. Mr Layard would be\nuseful to answer unimportant questions as to matters of fact, but all\nquestions involving the Foreign Policy of the country will be answered\nby Viscount Palmerston as head of the Government, as was done when\nLord Clarendon was Foreign Secretary and in the House of Lords. But\nthere are not unfrequently great debates on Foreign Affairs in the\nHouse of Commons, and there are many members, some of them not perhaps\nof great weight, who join in attacks on such matters. It is of great\nimportance to your Majesty's Government to have a sufficient number\nof speakers on such occasions. Lord John Russell and Lord Herbert\nwere ready and powerful. Mr Gladstone is almost the only one on the\nTreasury Bench who follows up foreign questions close enough to take\nan active part; it would be of great advantage to Viscount Palmerston\nto have as assistant on such occasions a man like Mr Layard, knowing\nthe details of matters discussed, able to make a good speech in reply\nto Mr Fitzgerald, or Mr Baillie Cochrane, or Mr Hennessy, or\nSir G. Bowyer, and who would shape his course in strict conformity\nwith the line which might be chalked out for him by Viscount\nPalmerston. Your Majesty need therefore be under no apprehension that\nMr Layard or anybody else, who might in the House of Commons hold the\noffice of Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, would appear\nto the world as the organ or representative of the Foreign Policy of\nyour Majesty's Government. With respect to giving Mr Layard any other\noffice of the same kind, there is none other in which he could be\nplaced without putting into the Foreign Office somebody far less fit\nfor it, and putting Mr Layard into some office for which he is far\nless fit. His fitness is for the Foreign Department, and to use the\nillustration, which was a favourite one of the late Mr Drummond,\nit would be putting the wrong man into the wrong hole. Viscount\nPalmerston has, as charged with the conduct of the business of the\nGovernment in the House of Commons, sustained a severe loss by the\nremoval of two most able and useful colleagues, Lord Herbert and\nLord John Russell, and he earnestly hopes that your Majesty will be\ngraciously pleased to assist him in his endeavours, not indeed to\nsupply their place, but in some degree to lessen the detriment which\ntheir removal has occasioned.",

    "body": "Viscount Palmerston presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and\nhastens to answer the enquiry contained in your Majesty's note, which\nwas delivered to him at Southampton. He must, in the first place,\nexplain that much of what was said to him by the King of Sweden and by\nPrince Oscar was not clearly understood by him. They would both\nspeak English--which they spoke with difficulty and in an indistinct\nutterance of voice--and he did not like to break the conversation into\nFrench, because to have done so would have looked like a condemnation\nof their English, of any imperfection of which they did not seem to be\nat all conscious.\nThe King was very guarded in all he said about France; the Prince\nspoke with more freedom and with less caution. The result of what\nViscount Palmerston gathered from their conversation, and perhaps for\nthis purpose they may be put together, because they probably both feel\nand think nearly alike, though the Prince lets his thoughts out more\nthan the King, may be summed up as follows.\nThey were much pleased and flattered by the kind and friendly\nreception given them by the French Emperor, and both he and they seem\nto have had present to their minds that the existing Royal Family of\nSweden is descended from General Bernadotte--a General in the Army of\nthe First Napoleon. They think the French Emperor sincerely desirous\nof maintaining his alliance with England, believing it to be for his\ninterest to do so. But they consider the French Nation essentially\naggressive, and they think that the Emperor is obliged to humour\nthat national feeling, and to follow, as far as the difference of\ncircumstances will allow, the policy of his Uncle. They consider the\nprinciple of nationalities to be the deciding principle of the day,\nand accordingly Venetia ought to belong to Italy, Poland ought to\nbe severed from Russia, and Finland ought to be restored to Sweden.\nHolstein should be purely German with its own Duke, Schleswig should\nbe united to Denmark, and when the proper time comes, Denmark, so\nconstituted, ought to form one Monarchy with Sweden and Norway. But\nthey see that there are great if not insuperable obstacles to all\nthese arrangements, and they do not admit that the Emperor of the\nFrench talked to them about these things, or about the map of Europe\nrevised for 1860. They lamented the dangerous state of the Austrian\nEmpire by reason of its financial embarrassments, and its differences\nbetween Vienna and Hungary. They admitted the difficulty of\nre-establishing a Polish State, seeing that Russia, Prussia, and\nAustria are all interested in preventing it; but they thought that\nRussia might make herself amends to the Eastward for giving up part of\nher Polish possessions.\nThey said the Swedes would be more adverse than the Danes to a Union\nof Denmark with Sweden. They said the Finns are writhing under the\nRussian yoke, and emigrate in considerable numbers to Sweden. They\nthink Russia paralysed for ten years to come by her war against\nEngland and France, by her internal changes, and her money\nembarrassments. When the Prince asked Viscount Palmerston to sit down,\nit was for the purpose of urging in the strongest and most earnest\nmanner that some British ships of war, or even one single gunboat, if\nmore could not be spared, should every year visit the Baltic, and make\na cruise in that sea. He said that the British Flag was never seen\nthere, although Great Britain has great interests, commercial and\npolitical, in that sea. That especially for Sweden it would be a great\nsupport if a British man-of-war were every year to show itself in\nSwedish waters. He said that our Navy know little or nothing of the\nBaltic, and when a war comes, as happened in the late war with Russia,\nour ships are obliged, as it were, to feel their way about in the\ndark; that the Russians send ships of war into British ports--why\nshould not England send ships of war into Russian ports? That we\nsurvey seas at the other side of the Globe, why should we not survey\na sea so near to us as the Baltic; that as far as Sweden is concerned,\nBritish ships would be most cordially received. I said that this\nshould receive due consideration; and in answer to a question he said\nthe best time for a Baltic cruise would be from the middle of June to\nthe latter end of August.\nThey both thought the Emperor of the French extremely popular in\nFrance--but, of course, they only saw outward demonstrations. They\nare very anxious for the maintenance of the Anglo-French Alliance;\nand they think the Emperor obliged to keep a large Army and to build a\nstrong Navy in order to please and satisfy the French Nation. Such\nis the summary of the impression made upon Viscount Palmerston by the\nanswers and observations drawn out by him in his conversations with\nthe King and the Prince; most of these things were said as above\nreported, some few of the above statements are perhaps inferences and\nconclusions drawn from indirect answers and remarks.",

His desire to acquire Denmark and\nFinland is not unnatural, and would not be very dangerous; but\nthe important part of the matter is, that the Emperor Napoleon has\nevidently tried to bribe him for his schemes by such expectations.\nAfter having established a large kingdom, dependent upon him and\npossessing a fleet, in the South of Europe on his right flank, he\nevidently tries to establish by the same means a similar power on his\nleft flank in the North. If then the Revolution of Poland and Hungary\ntakes Germany also in the rear, he will be exactly in the all-powerful\nposition which his Uncle held, and at which he himself aims, with that\none difference: that, unlike his Uncle, who had to fight England all\nthe time (who defended desperately her interests in Europe), he tries\nto effect his purposes in alliance with England, and uses for this end\nour own _free_ Press and in our own free country!\nThe Polish and Hungarian Revolutions (perhaps the Russian) and the\nassistance which may be (nobly?) given to them by Sweden, can easily\nbe made as popular in this country as the Italian has, and efforts\nto produce this result are fully visible already. The position and\nprospects of the Ally, when the Emperor shall have the whole Continent\nat his feet, and the command of the Mediterranean and the Baltic,\nwill not be a very pleasant one. Moreover, the Ally will probably have\nirritated him and the French Nation all the time by abusing them, and\nby showing that, although we may have approved of her policy, we did\nnot intend that France should reap any benefits from it. All this is\nprobably not thought of by our journalists, but requires the serious\nattention of our statesmen.\nLord Palmerston will perhaps show this letter to Lord Russell when he\nsends him the copies of the Memoranda, which he will probably do.",

The first\nevening was terribly trying, and I must say quite overpowered me for a\nshort time; _all_ looked _like life_, and yet _she_ was not there!

The pure, tender, loving spirit\n_which loved us_ so tenderly, is above us--loving us, praying for us,\nand _free_ from _all_ suffering and woe--_yes_, that _is_ a _comfort_,\nand that _first birthday_ in _another_ world must have been a _far_\nbrighter one than _any_ in this poor world below!

The English could not help\nfeeling proud of the way the Princess Royal was spoken of, and the\nhigh esteem she is held in. For one so young it is a most flattering\nposition, and certainly as the Princess's charm of manner and her kind\nunaffected words had in that short time won her the hearts of all the\nofficers and strangers present, one was not astonished at the praise\nthe Prussians themselves bestow on Her Royal Highness. The Royal\nFamily is so large, and their opinions politically and socially\nsometimes so different, that it must have been very difficult indeed\nat first for the Princess Royal, and people therefore cannot praise\nenough the high principles, great discretion, sound judgment, and\ncleverness Her Royal Highness has invariably displayed.\nYour Majesty would have been amused to hear General Wrangel tell\nat the top of his voice how delighted the soldiers were to see the\nPrincess on horseback, and the interest she showed for them. What\npleased them specially was to see Her Royal Highness ride without a\nveil--such an odd thing in soldiers to remark. The King of Prussia\nis looking very well, but the Queen I thought very much altered. Her\nMajesty looks very pale and tired, and has such a painful drawn look\nabout the mouth. How the Queen will be able to go through all the\nfatigues of the Coronation I do not know, as Her Majesty already\ncomplained of being tired, and knocked up by the man[oe]vres and\ndinners, and had to go to Mentz for a few days to rest herself.\nTheir Majesties' kindness was very great, and the Duke told me of the\nextreme hospitality with which they were entertained. Every one,\nhigh and low, were rivalling each other in civility and friendliness\ntowards the strangers, especially the English, and one really felt\nquite ashamed of those wanton attacks the _Times_ always makes on\nPrussia, and which are read and copied into all the Prussian papers.\nThe last night all the officers dined together. General Forey put\nhimself into the President's place and insisted, to the exclusion of\nLord Clyde, who was by far the senior officer, and who was expected\nto do it, on proposing the health of the King, the Royal Family, the\nArmy, and Nation. Not content with doing it in French, he drew out of\nhis pocket a document written for him in German, for he did not know\nthe language, and read it with the most extraordinary pronunciation.\nThe English officers all admired the way the Germans kept their\ncountenance notwithstanding the absurdity of the exhibition.\nOn the 21st they have had great doings here at Hanover. I hear that to\nthe astonishment of everybody the Queen appeared at the _Enth\u00fcllung_,\nwhere all other people were _en grande tenue_, in a little small round\nhat with a lilac feather. Her Maids of Honour--she has only one now\nbesides that English Miss Stewart--were ordered to wear hats to keep\nHer Majesty in countenance. I wonder if your Majesty has read the\nspeech the King has addressed to his people on the occasion of the\n_Enth\u00fcllung_ and the Crown Prince's birthday. It cannot fail to excite\nthe greatest pity that such things, however well meant, should be\nwritten. Has your Majesty also heard of the pamphlet that has been\npublished here called _Das Welfe_--that name Welfe is quite an _id\u00e9e\nfixe_ of the King now, and he brings it in on every occasion, and\nthis pamphlet is written throwing the whole idea into ridicule, and\nbeginning with the last years of the late King's reign. The Crown\nPrince is very much liked, but, unfortunately, his new tutor will\nprobably also leave very shortly--he has no authority over him, the\nPrince still regretting M. de Issendorf. Besides, he is not allowed\nto exercise his judgment in the smallest way--the King going on the\nprinciple that a King only can educate a King. The reason the\nother tutor left, or was dismissed, was partly on account of his\nremonstrating against the religious instructions, which were carried\nso far that the Prince had hardly any time left to learn other\nthings. Besides the Prince, who dislikes the clergyman, had drawn a\ncaricature, to which the man very much gives himself, and the King\nthought M. de Issendorf had known of it, which turned out not to be\nthe case.... I have the honour to remain, your Majesty's most obedient\nand devoted Servant and Subject,\nLOUISE MANCHESTER.",

I have got\nsuch a very bad cold on my chest, with a cough that leaves me no rest,\nand of course cannot take care of myself, and am obliged to stand and\nsit in every sort of draught with a low gown and without a cloak, so\nit is no wonder to have caught cold. I have not had a cough since\nI don't know when. I should like to be able to describe yesterday's\nceremony to you, but I cannot find words to tell you how fine and how\ntouching it was; it really was a magnificent sight! The King looked so\nvery handsome and so noble with the crown on; it seemed to suit him so\nexactly. The Queen, too, looked beautiful, and did all she had to do\nwith perfect grace, and looked so _vornehm_; I assure you the whole\nmust have made a great impression on everybody present, and all those\nto whom I have talked on the subject quite share my feeling. The\nmoment when the King put the crown on the Queen's head was very\ntouching, I think there was hardly a dry eye in the church. The\n_Schlosshof_ was the finest, I thought--five bands playing \"God save\nthe Queen,\" banners waving in all directions, cheers so loud that they\nquite drowned the sound of the music, and the procession moving slowly\non, the sky without a cloud; and all the uniforms, and the ladies'\ndiamonds glittering in the bright sunlight. I shall never forget it\nall, it was so very fine! Dearest Fritz's birthday being chosen for\nthe day made me very happy; he was in a great state of emotion and\nexcitement, as you can imagine, as we all were. Mr Thomas was in\nthe chapel. I hope he will have been able to take down some useful\nmemoranda. The Grand Duke of Weimar, the King and ourselves, have\nordered drawings of him.\nThe _coup d'[oe]il_ was really beautiful; the chapel is in itself\nlovely, with a great deal of gold about it, and all hung with red\nvelvet and gold--the carpet, altar, thrones and canopies the same. The\nKnights of the Black Eagle with red velvet cloaks, the Queen's four\nyoung ladies all alike in white and gold, the two Palastdamen in\ncrimson velvet and gold, and the Oberhofmeisterin in gold and white\nbrocade with green velvet, Marianne and Addy in red and gold and red\nand silver; I, in gold with ermine and white satin, my ladies, one\nin blue velvet, the other in red velvet, and Countess Schulenberg,\ntogether with the two other Oberhofmeisterin of the other Princesses,\nin violet velvet and gold. All these colours together looked very\nbeautiful, and the sun shone, or rather poured in at the high windows,\nand gave quite magic tinges.\nThe music was very fine, the chorales were sung so loud and strong\nthat it really quite moved one. The King was immensely cheered,\nwherever he appeared--also the Queen, and even I.\nThere were illuminations last night, but I did not go to see them,\nas I was too tired and felt so unwell. There are five degrees of cold\n(R\u00e9aumur), and one is exposed to draughts every minute.\nSixteen hundred people dined in the Schloss last night! The King and\nQueen were most kind to me yesterday; the King gave me a charming\nlittle locket for his hair, and only think--what will sound most\nextraordinary, absurd, and incredible to your ears--made me Second\n_Chef_ of the 2nd Regiment of Hussars! I laughed so much, because\nreally I thought it was a joke--it seemed so strange for ladies; but\nthe Regiments like particularly having ladies for their _Chefs!_ The\nQueen and the Queen Dowager have Regiments, but I believe I am the\nfirst Princess on whom such an honour is conferred.\nThe Archduke addressed the King yesterday, in the name of all the\nforeign Princes present, in a very pretty speech.\nIt is such a pleasure to see good Philip here, and the two Portuguese\ncousins. Juan is very nice, but he does not talk much; he has a\nvery fine, tall figure, and is nice-looking. I should think he must\nbe like his father. Prince Hohenzollern  is become Royal Highness,\nand the title is to descend to his eldest son. Half Europe is here,\nand one sees the funniest combinations in the world. It is like\na happy family shut up in a cage! The Italian Ambassador sat near\nCardinal Geisel, and the French one opposite the Archduke. The\nGrand Duke Nicolas is here--he is so nice--also the Crown Prince\nof W\u00fcrtemberg, Crown Prince of Saxony, Prince Luitpold of\nBavaria, Prince Charles of Hesse (who nearly dies of fright\nand shyness amongst so many people), and Heinrich; Prince Elimar of\nOldenburg, Prince Frederic of the Netherlands, and the\nGrand Duke and Duchess of Weimar, who wish to be most particularly\nremembered to you and Papa.\nThe King and Queen are most kind to Lord Clarendon, and make a marked\ndifference between their marked cordiality to him and the stiff\netiquette with which the other Ambassadors are received.\nI think he is pleased with what he sees. The King has given the Queen\nthe Order of the Black Eagle in diamonds. I write all these details,\nas you wish them, at the risk of their not interesting you, besides\nmy being, as you know, a very bad hand at descriptions. I shall make a\npoint of your having newspapers.\nI am unable to appear at the _cour_ this morning, as my cough is too\nviolent: I hope to be able to be at the concert this evening, but I\nown it seems very doubtful. The state dinner looked very well; we were\nwaited on by our _Kammerherren_ and pages--the King being waited on\nby the _Oberhofchargen_--and our ladies stood behind our chairs. After\nthe first two dishes are round, the King asks to drink, and that is\nthe signal for the ladies and gentlemen to leave the room and go to\ndinner, while the Pages of Honour continue to serve the whole dinner\nreally wonderfully well, poor boys, considering it is no easy task.\nTo-morrow we leave K\u00f6nigsberg for Dantzic--we have not had one day's\nbad weather here, nothing but sunshine and a bright blue sky. I was so\nglad that Heaven smiled upon us yesterday, it would have been so sad\nif it had poured; it looked a little threatening early in the morning\nand a few drops fell, but it cleared completely before nine o'clock.\nFritz would thank you for your dear letters himself, but he is at the\nUniversity, where they have elected him _Rector Magnificus_, and where\nhe has to make a speech. We have all got our servants and carriages\nand horses here _every_ day--300 footmen in livery, together with\nother servants in livery, make 400. All the standards and colours of\nthe whole Army are here, and all the Colonels. Altogether, you cannot\nimagine what a crush and what a scramble there is on every occasion;\nthere was a man crushed to death in the crowd the other day, which\nis quite dreadful. I must say good-bye now, and send this scrawl by\na messenger, whom Lord Clarendon means to expedite. Ever your most\ndutiful and affectionate Daughter,\nVICTORIA.",

Lord Clarendon is at\na loss for words to describe to your Majesty the exquisite grace and\nthe intense emotion with which Her Royal Highness gave effect to her\nfeelings on the occasion. Many an older as well as younger man than\nLord Clarendon, who had not his interest in the Princess Royal, were\nquite as unable as himself to repress their emotion at that which was\nso touching, because so unaffected and sincere....\nIf His Majesty had the mind, the judgment, and the foresight of the\nPrincess Royal, there would be nothing to fear, and the example\nand influence of Prussia would soon be marvellously developed. Lord\nClarendon has had the honour to hold a very long conversation with\nHer Royal Highness, and has been more than ever astonished at the\n_statesmanlike_ and comprehensive views which she takes of the policy\nof Prussia, both internal and foreign, and of the _duties_ of a\nConstitutional King.\nLord Clarendon is not at all astonished, but very much pleased, to\nfind how appreciated and beloved Her Royal Highness is by all classes.\nEvery member of the Royal Family has spoken of her to Lord Clarendon\nin terms of admiration, and through various channels he has had\nopportunities of learning how strong the feeling of educated and\nenlightened people is towards Her Royal Highness. All persons say\nmost truly that any one who saw Her Royal Highness yesterday can never\nforget her.\nLord Clarendon is sorry to say that the Princess Royal has a feverish\ncold to-day--nothing at all serious--and as Her Royal Highness stayed\nin bed this afternoon, did not attend the great concert at the Palace\nthis evening, and, as Lord Clarendon hopes, will not go to Dantzic\nto-morrow, Her Royal Highness will probably be quite fit for the many\nfatiguing duties she will have to perform next week....",

Her Majesty said, however, that she\nand the King, and all sensible men with whom their Majesties hold\ncommunication, were determined to disregard the attacks, and by every\npossible means to draw nearer to England.\nLord Clarendon took the opportunity of warning the Queen respecting\nthe Emperor and his _id\u00e9e fixe_, that his dynasty could only be\nsecured by the territorial aggrandisement of France. Lord Clarendon\nexpressed his conviction that if the King had resembled M. de Cavour,\nsome strong proposals would already have been made to them, but that\nthe Emperor's plans had been foiled by the honourable character of the\nKing. There ought, nevertheless, to be no delusion here, but on the\ncontrary, a careful avoidance of the traps which cajolery and flattery\nwere setting for Prussia, because at any moment the Emperor might\nthink it necessary for his own purposes in France to seize upon the\nleft bank of the Rhine, and that all classes in France, no matter\nto what party belonging, would be delighted at his so doing, and his\npopularity and power in France would be enormously increased by it.\nThe Queen agreed, but was under the notion, which Lord Clarendon\nwas able effectually to dispel, that the dilapidated state of French\nfinances would prevent the Emperor from undertaking a war upon a large\nscale.\nLord Clarendon thinks that he strengthened the Queen's opinion\nrespecting \"eventualities\" and the necessity of making preparations\nand evoking a national spirit against foreign aggression, such as that\nrecently manifested in England, and which had done so much in favour\nof peace as far as we ourselves were concerned. Her Majesty, however,\nsaid that Prussian policy towards Germany opened so large a chapter\nthat she wished to reserve the discussion of it for our next\nconversation.\nLord Clarendon fears that Count Bernstorff is disposed to think that\nAustria's difficulty is Prussia's opportunity, and to be exigent as\nto the concessions upon which a better understanding between the two\ncountries must be based. Lord Clarendon was confidentially informed\nyesterday that a Cabinet had just been held for the first time since\nCount Bernstorff became a member of it, and that with respect to\ninternal affairs he had greatly alarmed and annoyed some of his\ncolleagues by his retrograde opinions. Lord Clarendon had the honour\nof dining with the Crown Prince and Princess last night. The dinner\nwas perfect, and everything conducted in the most admirable manner;\nthere was afterwards a ball at \"The Queen's\" which was really a\nsplendid f\u00eate. The festivities and the visitings are so uninterrupted\nthat everybody is unwell and tired. The Duc de Magenta's grand f\u00eate\ntakes place on the 29th. The Austrian Minister gives a ball to-morrow\n(_Sunday_), which day has unfortunately been fixed by the King, to the\nannoyance of all the English; but Lord Clarendon has determined that\nthe Embassy shall attend, otherwise the King might consider that we\nwished to give him a public lesson upon the observance of the Sabbath.\nLord Clarendon trusts that your Majesty will approve the decision.\nLord Granville's visit appears to be highly appreciated by the Court.",

Lord Palmerston,\nprobably not reading any German newspaper, nor having any personal\nintercourse with that country, can hardly be aware to what extent the\nmischief has already gone, though he will agree with the Queen that\nnational hatred between these two peoples is a real political calamity\nfor both. The Queen had often intended to write to Lord Palmerston\non the subject, and to ask him whether he would not be acting in the\nspirit of public duty if he endeavoured, as far at least as might\nbe in his power, to point out to the managers of the _Times_ (which\nderives some of its power from the belief abroad that it represents\nmore or less the feelings of the Government) how great the injury is\nwhich it inflicts upon the best interests of this country. She has,\nhowever, refrained from doing so, trusting in the chance of a change\nin tone, and feeling that Lord Palmerston might not like to enter into\ndiscussion with the Editors of the _Times_....\nThe Queen believes that Lord Palmerston is the only person who could\nexercise any influence over Mr Delane, and even if this should not\nbe much, it will be important that that gentleman should know the\nmischief his writings are doing, and that the Government sincerely\ndeplore it.",

Attempts have often\nbeen made to establish newspapers to be directed by political men,\nand to be guided by the same considerations by which those men would\ngovern their own conduct, but such papers have seldom succeeded.\nThe Peelite Party tried some years ago such an experiment with the\n_Morning Chronicle_, but after spending a very large sum of money\non the undertaking they were obliged to give it up. The _Times_ is\ncarried on as a large commercial enterprise, though, of course, with\ncertain political tendencies and bias, but mainly with a view to\nprofit upon the large capital employed.\nThe actual price at which each copy of the newspaper is sold barely\npays the expense of paper, printing, and establishment; it is indeed\nsaid that the price does not repay those expenses. The profit of\nthe newspaper arises from the price paid for advertisements, and\nthe greater the number of advertisements the greater the profit. But\nadvertisements are sent by preference to the newspaper which has the\ngreatest circulation; and that paper gets the widest circulation which\nis the most amusing, the most interesting, and the most instructive.\nA dull paper is soon left off. The proprietors and managers of the\n_Times_ therefore go to great expense in sending correspondents to all\nparts of the world where interesting events are taking place, and they\nemploy a great many able and clever men to write articles upon all\nsubjects which from time to time engage public attention; and as\nmankind take more pleasure in reading criticism and fault-finding than\npraise, because it is soothing to individual vanity and conceit to\nfancy that the reader has become wiser than those about whom he reads,\nso the _Times_, in order to maintain its circulation, criticises\nfreely everybody and everything; and especially events and persons,\nand Governments abroad, because such strictures are less likely to\nmake enemies at home than violent attacks upon parties and persons in\nthis country. Foreign Governments and Parties ought therefore to look\nupon English newspapers in the true point of view, and not to be too\nsensitive as to attacks which those papers may contain.",

Her Royal Highness's countenance bears\ntraces of the severe illness of the last few days, but Lord Clarendon\ntrusts that the worst is now over, and that care alone is necessary\nfor her complete recovery. Her Royal Highness is still so weak that\nshe was obliged to desist from writing, which she attempted this\nmorning, and Lord Clarendon took the liberty of earnestly recommending\nthat the journey to Breslau, upon which Her Royal Highness appeared to\nbe bent, should be given up. Lord Clarendon intends to repeat the same\nadvice to the Queen, whom he is to see this evening, as there are to\nbe four days of rejoicings at Breslau, for the fatigue of which the\nCrown Princess must be utterly unfit.\nHer Royal Highness is much alarmed at the state of things here, and\nLord Clarendon thinks with great reason, for the King has quite made\nup his mind as to the course that he will pursue. He sees democracy\nand revolution in every symptom of opposition to his will. His\nMinisters are mere clerks, who are quite content to register the\nKing's decrees, and there is no person from whom His Majesty seeks\nadvice, or indeed who is capable or would have the moral courage to\ngive it. The King will always religiously keep his word, and will\nnever overturn the institutions he has sworn to maintain, but they\nare so distasteful to him, and so much at variance with his habit of\nthought and settled opinions as to the rights of the Crown, that His\nMajesty will never, if he can avoid it, accept the consequences\nof representative Government, or allow it to be a reality. This is\ngenerally known, and among the middle classes is producing an uneasy\nand resentful feeling, but as far as Lord Clarendon is able to judge,\nthere is no fear of revolution--the Army is too strong, and the\nrecollection of 1848 is too fresh to allow of acts of violence.\nLord Clarendon had the honour of an Audience of the King on Sunday.\nHis Majesty was most friendly and kind, but evidently unwell and\nirritable. Lord Clarendon therefore thought that it would be neither\nprudent nor useful to say the many things that the Queen had wished\nthat the King should hear from Lord Clarendon.

    "body": "... Viscount Palmerston met yesterday at dinner at Baron Brunnow's\nthe Grand Duke Constantine and the Grand Duchess, and they were\noverflowing with thankfulness for the kind and gracious reception they\nhad met with at Windsor Castle.\nThere was reason to suspect that an American federal steamer of war of\neight guns, which had lately arrived at Falmouth, and from thence at\nSouthampton, was intended to intercept the Mail Packet coming home\nwith the West Indian Mail, in order to take out of her Messrs Mason\nand Slidell, the two Envoys from the Southern Confederacy, supposed to\nbe coming in her.\nViscount Palmerston had on Monday a meeting at the Treasury of the\nChancellor, Doctor Lushington, the three Law Officers, the Duke\nof Somerset, Sir George Grey, and Mr Hammond. The result of their\ndeliberation was that, according to the Law of Nations, as laid down\nby Lord Stowell, and practised and enforced by England in the war\nwith France, the Northern Union being a belligerent is entitled by its\nships of war to stop and search any neutral Merchantmen, and the West\nIndia Packet is such; to search her if there is reasonable suspicion\nthat she is carrying enemy's despatches, and if such are found on\nboard to take her to a port of the belligerent, and there to proceed\nagainst her for condemnation. Such being ruled to be the law, the only\nthing that could be done was to order the _Phaeton_ frigate to drop\ndown to Yarmouth Roads from Portsmouth, and to watch the American\nsteamer, and to see that she did not exercise this belligerent right\nwithin the three-mile limit of British jurisdiction, and this was\ndone. But Viscount Palmerston sent yesterday for Mr Adams to ask him\nabout this matter, and to represent to him how unwise it would be to\ncreate irritation in this country merely for the sake of preventing\nthe landing of Mr Slidell, whose presence here would have no more\neffect on the policy of your Majesty with regard to America than the\npresence of the three other Southern Deputies who have been here for\nmany months. Mr Adams assured Viscount Palmerston that the American\nsteamer had orders not to meddle with any vessel under any foreign\nflag; that it came to intercept the _Nashville_, the Confederate ship\nin which it was thought the Southern Envoys might be coming; and not\nhaving met with her was going back to the American coast to watch some\nMerchantmen supposed to be taking arms to the Southern ports.\nViscount Palmerston heard from a source likely to be well informed\nthat at the interview between the Emperor and the King of Prussia\nat Compi\u00e8gne, the Emperor, among other things, said to the King that\nthere were three systems of alliance between which France and Prussia\nmight choose: an alliance of France with England, an alliance of\nPrussia with England, an alliance of France with Prussia. The first\nthe Emperor said now to a certain degree exists, but is precarious and\nnot likely to last long, because England is too exacting; the second\nwould not be useful to Prussia, but might be dangerous, inasmuch as it\nwould look like hostility to France, and England would not be likely\nto back Prussia effectually if a rupture took place between Prussia\nand France. The last was the system best for Prussia, and was\ncalculated to promote her interests; at all events, the Emperor hoped\nthat if at any time there should be a rupture between France and\nEngland, Prussia would remain neutral. The King of Prussia said he was\nnot come to discuss matters of that kind with the Emperor, but only\nto pay him a visit of compliment. Your Majesty will be able to compare\nthis statement with the accounts your Majesty may have received of\nwhat passed at that visit....\nThe Chancellor told the Cabinet as he was going away that he would\nsoon have to shut up the Court of Chancery in consequence of having\ndisposed of all the suits before it; and that in future the progress\nof a Chancery suit will be the emblem of rapidity, and not as formerly\nsynonymous with endless delay.",

But it was known\nthat the _San Jacinto_, though come from the African station, had\narrived from thence several weeks before, and had been at St Thomas,\nand had there received communications from New York; and it is also\nsaid that General Scott, who has recently arrived in France, has\nsaid to Americans in Paris that he has come not on an excursion of\npleasure, but on diplomatic business; that the seizure of these envoys\nwas discussed in Cabinet at Washington, he being present, and was\ndeliberately determined upon and ordered; that the Washington Cabinet\nfully foresaw it might lead to war with England; and that he was\ncommissioned to propose to France in that case to join the Northern\nStates in war against England, and to offer France in that case the\nrestoration of the French Province of Canada.\nGeneral Scott will probably find himself much mistaken as to the\nsuccess of his overtures; for the French Government is more disposed\ntowards the South than the North, and is probably thinking more about\nCotton than about Canada....",

It took place quite privately at sunrise on the\n19th. There is no burial-place for the Governor-General or his family,\nand the cemeteries at Calcutta are odious in many ways: Lord Canning\nhas therefore set a portion of the garden at Barrackpore (fifteen\nmiles from Calcutta) apart for the purpose.

The coffin was conveyed to\nBarrackpore by the Artillery, and was borne through the Garden by\nEnglish soldiers.\nLord Canning feels sure that your Majesty will not consider these\ndetails as an intrusion. He feels sure of your Majesty's kind\nsympathy. She loved your Majesty dearly, and Lord Canning is certain\nthat he is doing what would have been her wish in thus venturing to\nwrite to your Majesty. In the last connected conversation which he had\nwith her, just before the illness became really threatening, she said\nthat she must write again to the Queen, \"for I don't want her to think\nthat it was out of laziness that I was not at Allahabad.\" The fact is,\nthat she had always intended to be present at the Investiture, and had\nmade all her arrangements to go from Darjeeling to Allahabad for the\npurpose; but Lord Canning, hearing of the bad state of the roads,\nowing to the heavy and unseasonable rains, and knowing how fatiguing\nan additional journey of nearly 900 miles would be, had entreated her\nto abandon the intention, and to stay longer in the Hills, and then go\nstraight to Calcutta.
